        <h4>Constitutional Tools of Congressional Control</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Appropriations</strong>: Congress controls agency funding through appropriations powers</li>
            <li><strong>Oversight Hearings</strong>: Congress monitors agencies through committee hearings</li>
            <li><strong>Advice and Consent</strong>: Senate confirms or rejects presidential nominees to key agency positions</li>
            <li><strong>Statutory Specificity</strong>: Congress can limit agency discretion through detailed legislation</li>
            <li><strong>Congressional Review Act (CRA)</strong>: Allows Congress to disapprove new agency rules through joint resolutions subject to presidential veto</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="example">
        <h4>The Congressional Review Act</h4>
        <p>The Congressional Review Act (1996) provides a mechanism for Congress to review and potentially disapprove new federal regulations before they take effect. Key features include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Agencies must submit all rules to Congress before they can take effect</li>
            <li>Congress has 60 legislative days to pass a joint resolution of disapproval</li>
            <li>If the resolution passes and is signed by the President (or Congress overrides a veto), the rule cannot take effect</li>
            <li>An agency may not reissue a rule in "substantially the same form" unless specifically authorized by a subsequent law</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The CRA was rarely used until 2017, when it was employed to overturn 16 rules from the Obama administration. It continues to be used during presidential transitions when control of the White House changes parties.</p>

    <h3>Presidential Control of Agencies</h3>
    <p>The President exercises control over administrative agencies through various mechanisms derived from Article II of the Constitution, which vests executive power in the President and requires that the President "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed."</p>
    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>Competing Views on Presidential Authority</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unitary Executive Theory</strong>: The President has comprehensive control over the executive branch, including the power to direct agency decisions and remove officials at will</li>
            <li><strong>Oversight Model</strong>: The President's role is to oversee agencies and ensure faithful execution of the laws, but not to dictate substantive decisions when Congress has delegated authority to agencies</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>Tools of Presidential Control</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Executive Orders</strong>: Presidential directives that manage operations of the executive branch</li>
            <li><strong>Appointment Power</strong>: President nominates high-level agency officials (with Senate confirmation)</li>
            <li><strong>Removal Power</strong>: President can remove certain agency officials</li>
            <li><strong>Centralized Regulatory Review</strong>: Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) reviews significant agency rules</li>
            <li><strong>Budget Process</strong>: Presidential influence through OMB budget preparation</li>
            <li><strong>Directive Authority</strong>: Direct instructions to agencies (scope contested)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="example">
        <h4>OIRA Review</h4>
        <p>The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), located within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), conducts centralized review of significant regulatory actions. Key features include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Executive Order 12,866 (1993) requires executive agencies to submit significant regulatory actions to OIRA for review</li>
            <li>Agencies must conduct cost-benefit analysis for major rules</li>
            <li>OIRA reviews ensure consistency with presidential priorities</li>
            <li>Independent agencies are encouraged, but not required, to submit rules for OIRA review</li>
            <li>OIRA review has been criticized for causing delay and prioritizing economic concerns over health and safety</li>

    <h3>Appointment and Removal Powers</h3>
    <p>The Constitution's Appointments Clause (Article II, ยง 2) governs how officers of the United States are appointed, while the President's power to remove officers has been developed through Supreme Court doctrine.</p>
