    <h3>Approaching Administrative Law Exams</h3>

    <p>Administrative law exams typically present complex fact patterns that raise multiple issues across various doctrines. Success requires not only knowing the substantive law but also recognizing which issues to address and in what order. This section provides a structured approach for analyzing administrative law questions.</p>

    <div class="test-box">
        <h4>General Approach to Admin Law Questions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Identify the Agency Action</strong>: What is the agency doing (or not doing)? Is it rulemaking, adjudication, informal guidance, or something else?</li>
            <li><strong>Consider Threshold Issues</strong>: Can a court even hear this case?
                <ul>
                    <li>Reviewability (Is the action reviewable or "committed to agency discretion"?)</li>
                    <li>Standing (Does the plaintiff have Article III standing and fall within the zone of interests?)</li>
                    <li>Ripeness (Is the case ready for review or premature?)</li>
                    <li>Finality (Is the agency action "final" under the APA?)</li>
                    <li>Exhaustion (Has the plaintiff exhausted administrative remedies?)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Analyze Procedural Issues</strong>: Did the agency follow proper procedures?
                <ul>
                    <li>If rulemaking: Were notice-and-comment requirements followed? Was the action exempt?</li>
                    <li>If adjudication: Was formal adjudication required? Were proper procedures followed?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Assess Substantive Issues</strong>: Was the agency's action legally valid?
                <ul>
                    <li>Constitutional issues (nondelegation, major questions, separation of powers)</li>
                    <li>Statutory interpretation (Skidmore analysis after Loper Bright; whether the agency's interpretation is the best reading of the statute)</li>
                    <li>Arbitrary and capricious review (State Farm factors)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Analyze Potential Remedies</strong>: If the agency action is invalid, what should the court do?
                <ul>
                    <li>Remand without vacatur vs. vacatur</li>
                    <li>Nationwide injunction vs. as-applied relief</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

    <h3>Practice Questions</h3>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>Hypothetical 1: Major Questions Doctrine</h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issues a rule requiring all social media platforms with more than 10 million users to implement content moderation policies that remove false or misleading information within 24 hours. The FCC relies on a provision in its organic statute authorizing it to "make such rules and regulations... as may be necessary in the execution of its functions." Several tech companies challenge the rule.</p>
        <p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Would the Major Questions Doctrine apply to this agency action? Why or why not?</li>
            <li>How would the factors from <span class="case-name">West Virginia v. EPA</span> apply?</li>
            <li>Would your analysis change if Congress had specifically authorized the FCC to "regulate social media platforms to prevent the spread of misinformation"?</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>Hypothetical 2: Arbitrary and Capricious Review</h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issues a rule requiring warning labels on high-sugar beverages. The rule applies to sodas but exempts flavored coffee drinks and fruit juices, even though they often contain comparable amounts of sugar. In the rule's statement of basis and purpose, the FDA states that "sugary beverages pose health risks" but doesn't address why coffee drinks and fruit juices are exempt. A soda manufacturer challenges the rule as arbitrary and capricious.</p>
        <p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>What arguments would the soda manufacturer make under <span class="case-name">State Farm</span>?</li>
            <li>Would the FDA's rule likely be upheld or invalidated? Why?</li>
            <li>What could the FDA have done differently to strengthen its rule against challenge?</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>Hypothetical 3: Standing</h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> The Department of the Interior (DOI) lifts a ban on oil and gas leasing in a national wildlife refuge in Alaska. An environmental group whose members visit the refuge occasionally for bird-watching challenges the decision. The group argues that oil and gas development will harm wildlife and reduce their members' enjoyment of the area. DOI argues that the plaintiffs lack standing because development hasn't started yet and may never affect the specific areas the members visit.</p>
        <p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Do the environmental group's members have standing under <span class="case-name">Lujan</span>? Why or why not?</li>
            <li>How might the plaintiffs strengthen their standing arguments?</li>
            <li>Would the analysis change if the plaintiff was the State of Alaska rather than an environmental group?</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>Hypothetical 4: Post-Loper Bright Statutory Interpretation</h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> The Clean Water Act prohibits discharge of pollutants into "navigable waters," defined as "waters of the United States." The EPA and Army Corps of Engineers issue a rule interpreting this phrase to include wetlands with a "significant nexus" to traditionally navigable waters. A developer who wants to build on wetlands challenges the rule, arguing that "waters of the United States" should be limited to permanent, standing, or flowing bodies of water.</p>
        <p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>How would a court analyze this challenge after <span class="case-name">Loper Bright</span>?</li>
            <li>What traditional tools of statutory interpretation would be relevant?</li>
            <li>What role would the agencies' expertise play in the court's analysis?</li>

            <li>Standing analysis in administrative law cases</li>
            <li>The distinction between different types of rules exempt from notice and comment</li>
