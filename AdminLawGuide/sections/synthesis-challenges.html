        <h4>Agency Design and Authority Exercise</h4>
        <p>Congress creates a new federal agency, the Digital Privacy Commission (DPC), with a novel structure: five commissioners, each serving 10-year terms, removable by the President only for "neglect of duty or malfeasance." The commissioners may only be removed by a majority vote of the other commissioners, confirmed by the President. The DPC is authorized to "protect consumer privacy in the digital domain" and may impose civil penalties up to $500,000 per violation. Its funding comes directly from the penalties it collects, not congressional appropriations.</p>
        <p>The DPC issues a rule requiring all technology companies to obtain affirmative consent from users before collecting any data, with a complex set of requirements for what constitutes valid consent. The rule is expected to cost the technology sector $25 billion annually to implement. A technology industry association challenges the DPC's structure and the rule.</p>

            <h5>Multi-Doctrinal Analysis:</h5>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Removal Restrictions and Separation of Powers:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The dual layer of removal protection (commissioners can only be removed by other commissioners, who themselves have for-cause protection) likely violates Article II.</li>
                        <li>Under Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB (2010), dual for-cause removal restrictions impermissibly insulate officers from presidential control.</li>
                        <li>The 10-year terms further diminish presidential control over the agency.</li>
                        <li>The novel "commissioner majority vote" removal mechanism finds no support in Supreme Court precedent.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Appointments Clause:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If DPC commissioners are principal officers (likely given their authority and tenure), they must be nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate under Article II, § 2, Cl. 2.</li>
                        <li>If the statute specifies a different appointment method, it would raise constitutional concerns.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Non-Appropriations Funding Mechanism:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The self-funding mechanism may violate the Appropriations Clause (Art. I, § 9, Cl. 7).</li>
                        <li>By funding the DPC through penalties it collects rather than congressional appropriations, the structure diminishes both congressional and presidential oversight.</li>
                        <li>This creates problematic incentives for the agency to maximize enforcement for budgetary reasons.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Major Questions Doctrine:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The $25 billion economic impact clearly qualifies as a "major question."</li>
                        <li>The vague authority to "protect consumer privacy in the digital domain" likely lacks the clear congressional authorization required for such significant regulations.</li>
                        <li>Post-West Virginia v. EPA, courts demand explicit authorization for economically and politically significant rules.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Nondelegation Doctrine:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The broad authority to "protect consumer privacy" with minimal guidance may raise nondelegation concerns.</li>
                        <li>While the Supreme Court has rarely invalidated statutes on nondelegation grounds, several justices have expressed interest in revitalizing the doctrine.</li>
                        <li>The statute may lack an "intelligible principle" to guide the agency's discretion.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Arbitrary and Capricious Review:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Did the DPC examine relevant data about costs and benefits?</li>
                        <li>Did it consider important aspects of the problem, like varied impacts across different industries?</li>
                        <li>Did it consider reasonable alternatives, such as sector-specific approaches?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Most Serious Issues:</strong> The constitutional problems are severe. The dual-layer removal restrictions almost certainly violate Article II under Free Enterprise Fund, while the self-funding mechanism raises serious Appropriations Clause concerns. On the statutory side, the Major Questions Doctrine provides a strong challenge to the substantive rule given its enormous economic impact and the vague statutory authorization.</p>
            <p><strong>Likely Outcome:</strong> A court would likely find at least the removal restrictions unconstitutional, but might sever these provisions while leaving the agency intact. The substantive rule would likely be invalidated under the Major Questions Doctrine. The funding mechanism presents a novel question that could go either way, though recent trends suggest courts might view such congressional bypassing with skepticism.</p>

        <h4>Interlocking Doctrines Exercise</h4>
        <p>The Department of Energy (DOE) issues a rule requiring power plants nationwide to capture 90% of their carbon emissions, citing authority under a provision of the Clean Air Act that authorizes the agency to establish "the best system of emission reduction" for existing sources. The rule would effectively require all coal plants to implement carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology at a cost of approximately $20 billion. Three months after the final rule is published, a coalition of energy companies and several states challenge the rule. During litigation, the DOE publishes a new document titled "Implementation Guidance" that changes several key compliance dates and creates new exemptions for certain facilities "facing economic hardship." The guidance is issued without notice and comment procedures. The challengers amend their complaint to include challenges to the guidance document.</p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Analyze how multiple administrative law doctrines interact in this complex scenario.</p>

            <h5>Interlocking Doctrines Analysis:</h5>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Major Questions Doctrine & Statutory Authority:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The CCS mandate has vast economic significance ($20 billion cost) and transforms the power generation sector.</li>
                        <li>The authority to determine "the best system of emission reduction" is a general provision that likely lacks the clear congressional authorization required for such a transformative rule.</li>
                        <li>Following West Virginia v. EPA (which involved similar EPA regulations of power plants), the DOE likely lacks statutory authority for this specific mandate.</li>
                        <li>Post-Loper Bright, without Chevron deference, the court would determine if this is the best reading of the statutory text using traditional tools of interpretation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Timeliness & Ripeness:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The challenge is brought within three months, well within any applicable statute of limitations.</li>
                        <li>The final rule is clearly a consummated agency action with legal consequences, thus the challenge is ripe for review.</li>
                        <li>For the "Implementation Guidance," courts would need to determine if it constitutes final agency action under the Bennett v. Spear test.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Standing Doctrines:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Energy companies face direct compliance costs, satisfying injury, causation, and redressability requirements for Article III standing.</li>
                        <li>States likely have parens patriae standing to protect economic interests within their borders and may also have proprietary standing if they own any affected facilities.</li>
                        <li>States may also claim procedural injury from failure to follow proper rulemaking procedures.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Legislative vs. Interpretive Rules:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The "Implementation Guidance" appears to modify compliance obligations by changing deadlines and creating new exemptions.</li>
                        <li>These modifications have substantive legal effect rather than merely interpreting existing requirements.</li>
                        <li>Under cases like Appalachian Power v. EPA, guidance documents that effectively amend legislative rules require notice and comment.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Federalism & Cooperative Federalism:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The nationwide mandate implicates federalism concerns by potentially displacing traditional state authority over energy production.</li>
                        <li>Under the Clean Air Act's cooperative federalism structure, states typically implement federal standards with significant flexibility.</li>
                        <li>The direct federal mandate may conflict with this cooperative scheme.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Arbitrary & Capricious Review:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The agency would need to demonstrate that CCS technology is genuinely "adequately demonstrated" and economically feasible.</li>
                        <li>The rule must consider important aspects of the problem, including reliability concerns, regional differences, and economic impacts.</li>
                        <li>The sudden introduction of "economic hardship" exemptions suggests the original rule may have failed to adequately consider these factors.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Doctrinal Interactions:</strong> This complex scenario demonstrates how multiple administrative law doctrines interact in challenging agency action. The threshold issues (standing, ripeness, finality) must be satisfied before courts will consider the merits. On the merits, the statutory authority question (particularly through the Major Questions Doctrine lens) would likely be dispositive in light of West Virginia v. EPA. The procedural challenge to the guidance document represents a separate avenue for invalidation. Even if statutory authority existed, the rule would face rigorous arbitrary and capricious review.</p>
            <p><strong>Likely Outcome:</strong> Following West Virginia v. EPA, a court would almost certainly find the rule exceeds the DOE's statutory authority under the Major Questions Doctrine. Additionally, the "Implementation Guidance" would likely be deemed a legislative rule requiring notice and comment. The agency's attempt to modify compliance requirements through guidance suggests potential arbitrary and capricious issues with the underlying rule as well.</p>

        <h4>Complete Process Case Study</h4>
        <p>The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) proposes a rule requiring all manufacturers of children's toys to conduct third-party testing for 20 specific chemicals. During the comment period, many manufacturers submit studies questioning the scientific basis for testing requirements for 5 of these chemicals, arguing they're not harmful in the concentrations found in toys. The CPSC issues a final rule that maintains all 20 chemical testing requirements, stating only that it "disagrees with the industry studies."

            <p><strong>Likely Outcome:</strong> The court would likely find the CPSC's cursory dismissal of scientific studies arbitrary and capricious under State Farm, which requires agencies to examine relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for their actions. The court would almost certainly remand for further explanation or reconsideration of the 5 contested chemicals. The court might sever and uphold the requirements for the 15 uncontested chemicals while vacating the requirements for the 5 contested chemicals.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Administrative Law Principles Illustrated:</strong> This scenario demonstrates the importance of reasoned agency decision-making, the requirement to respond meaningfully to significant comments, and how courts enforce these requirements through arbitrary and capricious review. It also illustrates the court's remedial flexibility in administrative law cases.</p>

    <p>Administrative law involves balancing competing policy concerns like expertise, democratic accountability, efficiency, and rights protection. These exercises explore how these tensions manifest in concrete cases.</p>
    
    <div class="interactive-element">
        <h4>Expertise vs. Democratic Accountability</h4>
        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issues a rule establishing stringent air quality standards based on complex scientific studies about the health effects of particulate matter. The rule is projected to save thousands of lives annually but will cost certain industries billions of dollars to implement. During the previous administration, the EPA had proposed but not finalized much less stringent standards based on different scientific models. The new administration explicitly cites policy priorities of environmental protection and climate change mitigation as factors in its decision. Industry groups challenge the rule, arguing the EPA inappropriately considered political factors rather than making a purely scientific determination.</p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> How should courts balance agency expertise with democratic accountability through the political branches? What legal standards apply?</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Administrative agencies embody a tension: they are expert bodies with technical knowledge, but also part of the executive branch subject to presidential policy direction.</li>
                        <li>Pure technocracy would ignore democratic accountability; pure politics would undermine expertise-based decision-making.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>In State Farm, the Court suggested that purely political considerations cannot justify regulatory action without reasoned explanation.</li>
                        <li>However, in Fox Television, Justice Scalia noted that a change in administration and its policy priorities is a permissible basis for regulatory change, so long as the agency acknowledges the change and provides good reasons.</li>
                        <li>Massachusetts v. EPA clarified that while agencies have discretion, they must ground decisions in the statutory criteria, not extra-statutory policy considerations.</li>

                <li><strong>Application to the EPA Air Quality Standards:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Clean Air Act typically requires the EPA to set air quality standards based on public health considerations with an "adequate margin of safety," not economic costs.</li>
                        <li>If the EPA explicitly relied on climate change policy (not specifically mentioned in the relevant CAA provisions), this could be problematic.</li>
                        <li>However, if the agency based its decision on scientific evidence about health effects while acknowledging that the administration's priorities influenced its approach to uncertainty in the evidence, this would likely be permissible.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Key Legal Standards:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The EPA must demonstrate that its standards are based on the statutory criteria (health effects) and supported by substantial evidence.</li>
                        <li>The agency must explain why it chose its approach over alternatives, including the previous administration's proposed standards.</li>
                        <li>If scientific evidence could support multiple conclusions, the agency may choose among reasonable alternatives, but must explain its reasoning.</li>
                        <li>If relying on new scientific studies, the agency must explain why these studies warrant a different outcome.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Proper vs. Improper Political Considerations:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Proper: Acknowledging administration priorities influenced how the agency weighed uncertain scientific evidence or exercised discretion within statutory bounds.</li>
                        <li>Improper: Basing the decision on factors not contemplated by the statute or ignoring relevant scientific evidence for political reasons.</li>
                        <li>The distinction is often subtle but crucial for judicial review.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Resolution Framework:</strong> Courts should apply a balanced approach that acknowledges the legitimacy of political direction while ensuring agencies adhere to statutory mandates and reasoned decision-making:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Examine whether the agency based its decision on factors that Congress intended it to consider in the authorizing statute.</li>
                <li>Review whether the agency examined the relevant scientific data and articulated a satisfactory explanation connecting that data to its conclusion.</li>
                <li>Acknowledge that when scientific evidence permits multiple reasonable interpretations, the administration's policy preferences may legitimately influence which reasonable interpretation the agency adopts.</li>
                <li>Require transparency about the role of policy considerations in the decision-making process.</li>
                <li>Ensure the agency properly explained any change in position from the previous administration.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Likely Outcome:</strong> If the EPA transparently explained its scientific basis while acknowledging policy considerations influenced its approach within statutory bounds, a court would likely uphold the rule. However, if the EPA explicitly relied on climate change considerations not contemplated by the Clean Air Act's national ambient air quality standards provisions, or if it failed to adequately explain its departure from the previous administration's approach, a court might find the decision arbitrary and capricious.</p>

    <p>These challenging hypotheticals test your ability to apply multiple doctrines to novel scenarios that push the boundaries of existing precedent.</p>
    
    <div class="interactive-element">
        <h4>Novel Agency Design Challenge</h4>
        <p>Congress creates the Emerging Technologies Commission (ETC) with a unique structure and authority. The ETC has seven commissioners: three appointed by the President with Senate confirmation, two appointed directly by the Speaker of the House, and two appointed directly by the Senate Majority Leader. Commissioners serve 8-year terms and can only be removed for "gross misconduct" by a supermajority vote of the commission itself. The ETC has authority to regulate "emerging technologies that pose significant risks to national security or public welfare," with power to ban technologies, mandate safety features, or impose operational restrictions. Its funding comes from a dedicated tax on technology companies based on their market capitalization. The ETC issues a rule requiring all artificial intelligence systems above a certain capability threshold to include monitoring features allowing government oversight of training processes and internal operations. The rule also prohibits deployment of certain AI capabilities deemed "high risk." A technology company challenges both the ETC's structure and its AI rule.</p>

            <h5>Constitutional Structure Analysis:</h5>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Appointments Clause Violations:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The appointment of commissioners directly by the Speaker and Senate Majority Leader clearly violates the Appointments Clause.</li>
                        <li>Under Buckley v. Valeo and subsequent cases, principal officers must be appointed by the President with Senate confirmation.</li>
                        <li>Even if commissioners were deemed inferior officers (unlikely given their authority and tenure), they would still need to be appointed by the President, department heads, or courts of law, not by legislators.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Separation of Powers - Removal Restrictions:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The self-removal mechanism (commission supermajority vote) contravenes the President's Article II authority.</li>
                        <li>Under Free Enterprise Fund, multiple layers of removal protection are unconstitutional.</li>
                        <li>The "gross misconduct" standard imposes a higher removal threshold than the typical "inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance" standard upheld for independent agencies.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Legislative Branch Encroachment:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Direct legislative appointment of executive officers violates basic separation of powers principles.</li>
                        <li>This structure gives Congress control over executive functions, contrary to Bowsher v. Synar's prohibition on congressional control over execution of laws.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Non-Appropriations Funding:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The dedicated tax funding mechanism raises Appropriations Clause concerns.</li>
                        <li>By circumventing annual appropriations, this structure diminishes congressional fiscal control.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h5>Statutory Authority & Regulatory Action Analysis:</h5>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Nondelegation Concerns:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The broad authority to regulate "emerging technologies that pose significant risks" may lack an intelligible principle.</li>
                        <li>The statute provides minimal guidance on what constitutes "significant risks."</li>
                        <li>While the Supreme Court has rarely invalidated statutes on nondelegation grounds, this broad delegation may be vulnerable under recent judicial skepticism.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Major Questions Doctrine:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Regulation of AI capabilities and mandating government monitoring features presents a question of vast economic and political significance.</li>
                        <li>The ETC would need clear congressional authorization for such sweeping regulation.</li>
                        <li>The general authority over "emerging technologies" likely lacks the specificity required under West Virginia v. EPA.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>First Amendment Implications:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Government monitoring of AI systems may implicate First Amendment concerns, particularly if AI systems generate speech or expression.</li>
                        <li>Prohibition on certain AI capabilities could restrict development of tools for artistic, journalistic, or expressive purposes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Fourth Amendment Considerations:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mandatory monitoring features allowing government oversight may constitute warrantless surveillance.</li>
                        <li>The rule would need to address Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <p><strong>Likely Outcome:</strong> The ETC's structure is clearly unconstitutional on multiple grounds, most obviously the Appointments Clause violation through legislative appointment of executive officers. A court would almost certainly invalidate the agency's structure. The AI regulation would likely fall as a result, though even if considered separately, it would face serious Major Questions Doctrine challenges, as the sweeping regulation of AI technology would require clear congressional authorization.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Severability Questions:</strong> A key question would be whether the unconstitutional structural provisions are severable from the rest of the statute. Given the fundamental nature of the Appointments Clause violation and its centrality to the agency's design, a court would likely find the entire agency structure inseverable and invalid. Even if the structural provisions were somehow severable, the AI rule would likely exceed the agency's statutory authority under the Major Questions Doctrine.</p>
