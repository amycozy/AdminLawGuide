    <h3>Reviewability: When Courts Can Review Agency Actions</h3>
    
    <p>Before a court can apply substantive standards of review to an agency action, it must first determine whether the action is reviewable at all. The APA creates a presumption of judicial review, but several exceptions limit this presumption.</p>
    
    <div class="statute-box">

            <li>agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.</li>

    <p>Standing is a constitutional and prudential doctrine that limits who can bring a lawsuit in federal court. To challenge an agency action, a plaintiff must satisfy both Article III's constitutional standing requirements and the "zone of interests" test under the APA.</p>

                    <li><strong>Redressability</strong>: While regulation might not reverse global warming entirely, it would slow or reduce it, and courts do not require complete redress of an injury</li>

                <p>The Court also emphasized states' special status as sovereign entities protecting their territory and citizens, which entitles them to "special solicitude" in the standing analysis.</p>

        <p>To have Article III standing, a plaintiff must establish three elements:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Injury in Fact</strong>: The plaintiff must have suffered an "injury in fact" that is:
                <ul>
                    <li>Concrete and particularized (not abstract or generalized)</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Causation</strong>: The injury must be "fairly traceable" to the challenged action of the defendant, not the result of independent action of a third party not before the court</li>
            <li><strong>Redressability</strong>: It must be "likely," as opposed to merely "speculative," that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In addition to these constitutional requirements, in APA cases, the plaintiff must also show that the interest they seek to protect is "arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute" that the agency action allegedly violated.</p>

    <h3>Ripeness: When Agency Actions Are Ready for Review</h3>
    
    <p>The ripeness doctrine ensures that courts review agency actions only when they are sufficiently concrete and when immediate review would not interfere with ongoing agency proceedings.

        <div class="case-facts">
            <p>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a "Biological Opinion" regarding a federal water project's impact on endangered species. The opinion concluded that the project would jeopardize certain species and proposed "reasonable and prudent alternatives" to protect the species while allowing the project to proceed. Two Oregon irrigation districts and ranchers challenged the opinion.</p>

        <div class="case-rule">
            <p>The Supreme Court articulated a two-prong test for determining whether an agency action is "final" under APA § 704:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The action must mark the consummation of the agency's decision-making process—it must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature</li>
                <li>The action must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The Court found that the Biological Opinion satisfied both prongs and thus was final agency action subject to judicial review.</p>

        <div class="case-facts">
            <p>Hawkes Co., which mines peat for use in golf courses, sought to expand its mining operations. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a jurisdictional determination (JD) stating that the property contained "waters of the United States" subject to Clean Water Act permitting requirements.

        <div class="case-rule">
            <p>The Supreme Court held that the Corps' JD was a final agency action subject to judicial review under the APA because it satisfied both prongs of the <span class="case-name">Bennett</span> test and there was no other adequate remedy available to Hawkes.</p>

                <li>The JD had legal consequences—a negative JD would provide a five-year safe harbor from enforcement, while a positive JD effectively left landowners with only two options: proceed without a permit and risk enforcement action, or apply for a costly permit they believe is unnecessary</li>
                <li>No other adequate remedy was available—pursuing a permit application or risking an enforcement action were not adequate alternatives to challenging the JD directly</li>

        <h4>Determining Finality Under <span class="case-name">Bennett</span></h4>
        <p>To be "final" agency action under the APA, the action must satisfy both prongs of the <span class="case-name">Bennett</span> test:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Consummation of Decision-Making</strong>: The action must represent the culmination of the agency's decision-making process, not a preliminary, procedural, or intermediate step</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Consequences</strong>: The action must determine rights or obligations or result in legal consequences. This may be shown by:
                <ul>
                    <li>Direct regulation of primary conduct</li>
                    <li>Creation of new legal rights or obligations</li>
                    <li>Changes to the legal framework governing regulated entities</li>

    <h3>Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies</h3>
    
    <p>The exhaustion doctrine requires parties to pursue all available administrative remedies before seeking judicial review. This requirement allows agencies to apply their expertise, develop a factual record, and potentially resolve disputes without court involvement.</p>

            <div class="case-facts">
            <p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) imposed administrative sanctions on a real estate developer for violations of federal regulations. The developer sought judicial review without exhausting optional administrative appeals within HUD, and HUD argued that the case should be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-rule">
            <p>The Supreme Court held that when the APA applies, courts may not require exhaustion of administrative remedies beyond those required by statute or agency rules. Section 704 of the APA limits the exhaustion doctrine to situations where explicitly mandated by statute or agency rule.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-reasoning">
            <p>Justice Blackmun's unanimous opinion:</p>

                <li>Courts may not impose additional exhaustion requirements beyond those provided by statute or agency rule</li>
                <li>Where an agency rule requires administrative appeal but does not make the initial decision inoperative during the appeal, the initial decision is final and reviewable under the APA</li>

        <p class="case-citation">503 U.S. 140</p>
        <div class="case-facts">
            <p>A federal prisoner filed a Bivens action seeking money damages for alleged deliberate indifference to his medical needs. The prisoner did not exhaust the Federal Bureau of Prisons' administrative remedy procedure, which could have provided various forms of relief but not the money damages he sought.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-rule">
            <p>The Supreme Court held that the prisoner was not required to exhaust administrative remedies before filing his Bivens action because (1) the Bureau's administrative procedure did not provide for recovery of money damages, (2) meaningful administrative review was compromised by the agency's institutional bias, and (3) the prisoner would face an unreasonable burden in exhausting administrative procedures.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-reasoning">
            <p>Justice Blackmun's opinion identified three circumstances where the interests of the individual weigh against requiring administrative exhaustion:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When requiring exhaustion would prejudice a subsequent court action (e.g., due to unreasonable delay or indefinite timeframe)</li>
                <li>When the agency is biased or has predetermined the issue</li>
                <li>When administrative remedies are inadequate (e.g., the agency lacks authority to grant effective relief)</li>
            </ul>

    </div>
    
    <div class="judicial-box">
        <h4>Purposes of the Exhaustion Doctrine</h4>
        <p>The exhaustion requirement serves several important purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Agency Expertise</strong>: Allows agencies to apply their specialized knowledge and experience to complex issues</li>
            <li><strong>Factual Development</strong>: Ensures development of a complete administrative record for judicial review</li>
            <li><strong>Agency Autonomy</strong>: Respects the agency's authority to correct its own errors</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Promotes efficiency by avoiding premature judicial intervention</li>
            <li><strong>Judicial Economy</strong>: Conserves judicial resources by potentially eliminating the need for court review</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="test-box">
        <h4>Exceptions to the Exhaustion Requirement</h4>
        <p>Courts may waive exhaustion requirements in several circumstances:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Futility</strong>: When exhaustion would be futile because the agency has predetermined the issue or lacks authority to provide relief</li>
            <li><strong>Inadequate Remedies</strong>: When administrative remedies are inadequate to provide the relief sought (e.g., money damages unavailable)</li>
            <li><strong>Irreparable Harm</strong>: When the plaintiff would suffer irreparable harm if required to pursue administrative remedies</li>
            <li><strong>Constitutional Questions</strong>: When the challenge involves a constitutional question clearly beyond the agency's jurisdiction or expertise</li>
            <li><strong>Bias</strong>: When the administrative body is biased or has prejudged the case</li>
        </ol>
