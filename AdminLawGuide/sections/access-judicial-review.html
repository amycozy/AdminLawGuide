    <h3>Reviewability: When Courts Can Review Agency Actions</h3>
    
    <p>Before a court can apply substantive standards of review to an agency action, it must first determine whether the action is reviewable at all. The APA creates a presumption of judicial review, but several exceptions limit this presumption.</p>
    
    <div class="statute-box">
        <h4>APA § 701: Application; Definitions</h4>
        <p>(a) This chapter applies, according to the provisions thereof, except to the extent that—</p>
        <ol>
            <li>statutes preclude judicial review; or</li>
            <li>agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.</li>

    <p>The APA authorizes judicial review of "final agency action."

    <h3>Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies</h3>

            <li><strong>Constitutional Questions</strong>: When the challenge involves a constitutional question clearly beyond the agency's jurisdiction or expertise</li>
