                <div class="interactive-element">
                    <h4>Scenario 1: Agency Authority</h4>
                    <p>The Department of Transportation (DOT) issues a rule requiring all smartphone manufacturers to include a feature that automatically disables text messaging capabilities when a phone is detected moving faster than 10 mph. The DOT claims authority under a statute that authorizes it to "issue regulations to enhance highway safety." Several technology companies challenge the rule.</p>
                    <div class="scenario-question">
                        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What doctrine(s) would you analyze to determine if DOT has the authority to issue this rule?</p>

                        <div id="answer1" class="scenario-answer" style="display:none;">
                            <p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Major Questions Doctrine:</strong> This is likely a question of vast economic and political significance, as it would impact every smartphone manufacturer and user in the country. Under this doctrine, the court would look for clear congressional authorization for DOT to regulate smartphone functionality.</li>
                                <li><strong>Statutory Authority:</strong> Does the broad language "enhance highway safety" clearly authorize regulation of smartphone manufacturing, which is not traditionally within DOT's regulatory sphere?</li>
                                <li><strong>Nondelegation Concerns:</strong> Is "enhance highway safety" an intelligible principle sufficient to guide the agency's discretion for this type of regulation?</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Given recent Supreme Court cases like West Virginia v. EPA, a court would likely find that Congress did not clearly authorize DOT to impose design requirements on smartphones, even if the purpose relates to highway safety.</p>

                    <h4>Scenario 2: Arbitrary and Capricious Review</h4>
                    <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issues a final rule reducing the permissible levels of a certain air pollutant from industrial sources. In its rulemaking, the EPA discusses the health benefits of the regulation but does not address industry concerns about technological feasibility or economic impacts raised during the comment period. An industry group challenges the rule as arbitrary and capricious.</p>
                    <div class="scenario-question">
                        <p><strong>Question:</strong> How would a court likely analyze this challenge under State Farm?</p>

                            <p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
                            <p>Under Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association v. State Farm, a court would likely find this rule arbitrary and capricious because:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The EPA failed to consider an important aspect of the problem (technological feasibility and economic impacts)</li>
                                <li>The agency did not respond to significant comments raised during the notice-and-comment period</li>
                                <li>The agency's explanation is incomplete, as it addresses only the benefits without considering the costs or implementation challenges</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>The court would likely remand to the agency to address these deficiencies in the rulemaking process, requiring the EPA to consider and respond to the industry concerns before finalizing the rule.</p>

                        <p>Interpretive rules explain the agency's understanding of the statutes or rules it administers without creating new legal obligations. If a rule creates new rights or obligations, it is a legislative rule that requires notice and comment under APA § 553.</p>

    <p>Practice applying administrative law doctrines to hypothetical scenarios. These exercises will help you develop the analytical skills needed for the exam.</p>
    
    <div class="interactive-element">
        <h4>Hard Look Review Exercise</h4>
        <p>Analyze this hypothetical agency action under State Farm's "hard look" review standard:</p>
        <blockquote>
            The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has required automobile manufacturers to install passive restraints (airbags or automatic seatbelts) in all new vehicles for the past 10 years. NHTSA now rescinds this requirement entirely, citing studies showing that driver education programs are equally effective at reducing fatalities. The agency did not consider requiring only airbags, despite evidence suggesting that airbags are more effective than automatic seatbelts. Several consumer safety groups challenge the rescission.

        <div id="answer-application1" class="scenario-answer" style="display:none;">
            <h5>State Farm Analysis Framework:</h5>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Examine the relevant data:</strong> Did NHTSA thoroughly review the data on passive restraints vs. driver education?</li>
                <li><strong>Articulate a satisfactory explanation:</strong> Has NHTSA explained the connection between the facts found and the choice made?</li>
                <li><strong>Consider important aspects:</strong> Did NHTSA fail to consider an important aspect of the problem by not evaluating an airbags-only option?</li>
                <li><strong>Respond to alternatives:</strong> Did NHTSA explain why it rejected obvious alternatives like requiring only airbags?</li>
                <li><strong>Change in position:</strong> Since this is a rescission of a longstanding rule, did NHTSA acknowledge the change and provide good reasons for it?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Based on the facts provided, a court would likely find this rescission arbitrary and capricious under State Farm because the agency failed to consider an important aspect of the problem (the airbags-only option) and did not adequately explain why driver education programs, which serve a different function than passive restraints, are an adequate substitute.</p>

    <h3 class="icon-legislative">Synthesis Challenges</h3>
    
    <p>Test your ability to integrate multiple administrative law doctrines in complex scenarios. These exercises help you build connections between different areas of the course.</p>
    
    <div class="interactive-element">
        <h4>Cross-Doctrinal Analysis: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</h4>
        <p>Analyze this scenario by identifying and applying all relevant administrative law doctrines:</p>
        <blockquote>
            Congress creates the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) with a single director who can only be removed by the President for "inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office." The CFPB, citing its authority to regulate "unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices," issues a rule requiring all credit card companies to simplify their fee structures and disclose fees more prominently. The rule would affect approximately $50 billion in annual credit card fees. Several credit card companies challenge both the constitutionality of the CFPB's structure and the substance of the rule.
        </blockquote>
        <button class="toggle-answer" data-target="answer-synthesis1">Show Multi-Doctrinal Analysis</button>
        <div id="answer-synthesis1" class="scenario-answer" style="display:none;">
            <h5>Doctrines to Apply:</h5>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Removal Power/Unitary Executive:</strong> Under Seila Law v. CFPB, the Supreme Court held that the CFPB's structure with a single director removable only for cause violated the separation of powers. The Court severed the removal restriction, allowing the CFPB to continue operating with a director removable at will by the President.</li>
                <li><strong>Major Questions Doctrine:</strong> Regulation affecting $50 billion in annual fees likely qualifies as a question of vast economic significance. Does the statute clearly authorize the CFPB to mandate specific fee structures, or is the language "unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices" too vague for such major regulation?</li>
                <li><strong>Statutory Authority:</strong> Even if the Major Questions Doctrine does not apply, does the CFPB's authority to regulate "unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices" encompass mandating specific fee structures?</li>
                <li><strong>Arbitrary and Capricious Review:</strong> Did the CFPB examine relevant data, articulate a satisfactory explanation, consider important aspects of the problem, and respond to alternatives?</li>
                <li><strong>Severability:</strong> If the removal restriction is unconstitutional, can it be severed from the rest of the statute?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This scenario requires balancing multiple doctrines from different areas of administrative law, including separation of powers, agency authority, and standards of review. After Seila Law, the constitutionality issue is largely settled (the removal restriction is unconstitutional but severable), so the case would likely focus on the Major Questions Doctrine and whether Congress clearly authorized the CFPB to make such significant economic regulations.</p>
