                <p>Test your ability to apply administrative law concepts to hypothetical situations. Think through these scenarios carefully before revealing the analysis.</p>
                
                <div class="interactive-element">
                    <h4>Scenario 1: Agency Authority</h4>
                    <p>The Department of Transportation (DOT) issues a rule requiring all smartphone manufacturers to include a feature that automatically disables text messaging capabilities when a phone is detected moving faster than 10 mph. The DOT claims authority under a statute that authorizes it to "issue regulations to enhance highway safety." Several technology companies challenge the rule.</p>
                    <div class="scenario-question">
                        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What doctrine(s) would you analyze to determine if DOT has the authority to issue this rule?</p>

                        <div id="answer1" class="scenario-answer" style="display:none;">
                            <p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Major Questions Doctrine:</strong> This is likely a question of vast economic and political significance, as it would impact every smartphone manufacturer and user in the country. Under this doctrine, the court would look for clear congressional authorization for DOT to regulate smartphone functionality.</li>
                                <li><strong>Statutory Authority:</strong> Does the broad language "enhance highway safety" clearly authorize regulation of smartphone manufacturing, which is not traditionally within DOT's regulatory sphere?</li>
                                <li><strong>Nondelegation Concerns:</strong> Is "enhance highway safety" an intelligible principle sufficient to guide the agency's discretion for this type of regulation?</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Given recent Supreme Court cases like West Virginia v. EPA, a court would likely find that Congress did not clearly authorize DOT to impose design requirements on smartphones, even if the purpose relates to highway safety.</p>

                    <h4>Scenario 2: Arbitrary and Capricious Review</h4>
                    <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issues a final rule reducing the permissible levels of a certain air pollutant from industrial sources. In its rulemaking, the EPA discusses the health benefits of the regulation but does not address industry concerns about technological feasibility or economic impacts raised during the comment period. An industry group challenges the rule as arbitrary and capricious.</p>

                        <p><strong>Question:</strong> How would a court likely analyze this challenge under State Farm?</p>

                            <p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
                            <p>Under Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association v. State Farm, a court would likely find this rule arbitrary and capricious because:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The EPA failed to consider an important aspect of the problem (technological feasibility and economic impacts)</li>
                                <li>The agency did not respond to significant comments raised during the notice-and-comment period</li>
                                <li>The agency's explanation is incomplete, as it addresses only the benefits without considering the costs or implementation challenges</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>The court would likely remand to the agency to address these deficiencies in the rulemaking process, requiring the EPA to consider and respond to the industry concerns before finalizing the rule.</p>
