    <h3>Introduction to Administrative Law</h3>
    
    <p>Administrative law governs how government agencies exercise authority and interact with the public. It encompasses the legal principles that control the creation and operation of administrative agencies, including rules concerning their powers, functions, and procedures, as well as judicial review of agency actions. As regulatory bodies have grown in scope and influence, administrative law has become an increasingly important field for understanding how government operates.</p>
    
    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>The Stakes in Administrative Law</h4>
        <p>Administrative law involves balancing competing interests:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Democratic Accountability</strong>: Ensuring that agencies remain accountable to elected officials and the public</li>
            <li><strong>Expertise</strong>: Leveraging specialized knowledge to address complex policy problems</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Enabling government to act effectively without excessive procedural burdens</li>
            <li><strong>Due Process</strong>: Protecting individual rights through procedural safeguards</li>
            <li><strong>Separation of Powers</strong>: Maintaining constitutional boundaries between branches of government</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p>Administrative agencies represent a practical response to the realities of modern governance, operating at the intersection of the three traditional branches of government: legislative, executive, and judicial. They often combine rulemaking (quasi-legislative), enforcement (executive), and adjudicative (quasi-judicial) functions, raising important constitutional and policy questions about the concentration of power.</p>
</div>

<div class="explanation" id="framework">
    <h3>Constitutional Framework</h3>
    
    <p>The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly mention administrative agencies, yet it provides the foundational structure within which these agencies operate. Key constitutional provisions include:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Article I</strong>: Vests legislative powers in Congress, raising questions about delegation of authority to agencies</li>
        <li><strong>Article II</strong>: Establishes the presidency and the requirement to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed"</li>
        <li><strong>Article III</strong>: Creates the judicial branch, which reviews agency actions but with important limitations</li>
        <li><strong>Due Process Clauses</strong>: Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee procedural protections when agencies act in ways that affect individual rights</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The Supreme Court has interpreted these constitutional provisions to allow for the administrative state to function while imposing certain constraints on agency power. A critical ongoing tension exists between enabling effective governance and preventing unchecked administrative authority.</p>

    <h3>Key Concepts in Administrative Law</h3>
    
    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>Administrative Agencies</h4>
        <p>Administrative agencies are government bodies created by legislation to implement and enforce laws in specific areas. They typically have specialized expertise and are charged with addressing complex societal problems that require technical knowledge and ongoing supervision.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples include:</strong> Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>The Administrative Procedure Act (APA)</h4>
        <p>Enacted in 1946, the APA provides the procedural framework that governs much of agency action. It establishes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Procedures for agency rulemaking and adjudication</li>
            <li>Requirements for public participation in agency decision-making</li>
            <li>Standards for judicial review of agency actions</li>
            <li>Publication requirements for agency rules and decisions</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>Rulemaking vs. Adjudication</h4>
        <p>Agencies exercise their authority primarily through two types of actions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rulemaking:</strong> The process of creating regulations with the force of law, typically prospective and general in application</li>
            <li><strong>Adjudication:</strong> Case-by-case resolution of particular disputes, typically retrospective and specific to the parties involved</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>Judicial Deference to Agencies</h4>
        <p>Courts often defer to agency interpretations and decisions, recognizing agencies' expertise and delegated authority. Key deference doctrines include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chevron Deference:</strong> Courts defer to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes they administer</li>
            <li><strong>Auer/Kisor Deference:</strong> Courts defer to agency interpretations of their own regulations</li>
            <li><strong>Skidmore Deference:</strong> Courts give weight to agency interpretations based on their persuasiveness</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: Recent Supreme Court decisions, particularly Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (2024), have significantly altered the landscape of judicial deference to agencies.</p>
