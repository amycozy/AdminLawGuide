                        <p>Final agency action is a requirement for reviewability under the APA, not for Article III standing. The three requirements for Article III standing are injury in fact, causation, and redressability.</p>

                        <p>In Loper Bright, the Supreme Court overturned Chevron deference. Courts now must determine the best reading of a statute using traditional tools of statutory interpretation, rather than deferring to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes.</p>

                        <p>Under APA § 701(a)(2), agency action is "committed to agency discretion by law" when the statute provides no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency's exercise of discretion.

            <h4>Scenario 1: Agency Authority</h4>
            <p>The Department of Transportation (DOT) issues a rule requiring all smartphone manufacturers to include a feature that automatically disables text messaging capabilities when a phone is detected moving faster than 10 mph. The DOT claims authority under a statute that authorizes it to "issue regulations to enhance highway safety." Several technology companies challenge the rule.</p>
            <div class="scenario-question">
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> What doctrine(s) would you analyze to determine if DOT has the authority to issue this rule?</p>

                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Major Questions Doctrine:</strong> This is likely a question of vast economic and political significance, as it would impact every smartphone manufacturer and user in the country. Under this doctrine, the court would look for clear congressional authorization for DOT to regulate smartphone functionality.</li>
                        <li><strong>Statutory Authority:</strong> Does the broad language "enhance highway safety" clearly authorize regulation of smartphone manufacturing, which is not traditionally within DOT's regulatory sphere?</li>
                        <li><strong>Nondelegation Concerns:</strong> Is "enhance highway safety" an intelligible principle sufficient to guide the agency's discretion for this type of regulation?</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Given recent Supreme Court cases like West Virginia v. EPA, a court would likely find that Congress did not clearly authorize DOT to impose design requirements on smartphones, even if the purpose relates to highway safety.</p>

            <h4>Scenario 2: Arbitrary and Capricious Review</h4>
            <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issues a final rule reducing the permissible levels of a certain air pollutant from industrial sources. In its rulemaking, the EPA discusses the health benefits of the regulation but doesn't address industry concerns about technological feasibility or economic impacts raised during the comment period. An industry group challenges the rule as arbitrary and capricious.</p>

                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
                    <p>Under Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association v. State Farm, a court would likely find this rule arbitrary and capricious because:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The EPA failed to consider an important aspect of the problem (technological feasibility and economic impacts)</li>
                        <li>The agency did not respond to significant comments raised during the notice-and-comment period</li>
                        <li>The agency's explanation is incomplete, as it addresses only the benefits without considering the costs or implementation challenges</li>

            <h4>Hypothetical 1: Major Questions Doctrine</h4>
            <p><strong>Facts:</strong> The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issues a rule requiring all social media platforms with more than 10 million users to implement content moderation policies that remove false or misleading information within 24 hours. The FCC relies on a provision in its organic statute authorizing it to "make such rules and regulations... as may be necessary in the execution of its functions." Several tech companies challenge the rule.</p>
            <p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Would the Major Questions Doctrine apply to this agency action? Why or why not?</li>
                <li>How would the factors from <span class="case-name">West Virginia v. EPA</span> apply?</li>
                <li>Would your analysis change if Congress had specifically authorized the FCC to "regulate social media platforms to prevent the spread of misinformation"?</li>

            <h4>Hypothetical 2: Standing</h4>
            <p><strong>Facts:</strong> The Department of the Interior (DOI) lifts a ban on oil and gas leasing in a national wildlife refuge in Alaska. An environmental group whose members visit the refuge occasionally for bird-watching challenges the decision. The group argues that oil and gas development will harm wildlife and reduce their members' enjoyment of the area. DOI argues that the plaintiffs lack standing because development hasn't started yet and may never affect the specific areas the members visit.</p>
            <p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Do the environmental group's members have standing under <span class="case-name">Lujan</span>? Why or why not?</li>
                <li>How might the plaintiffs strengthen their standing arguments?</li>
                <li>Would the analysis change if the plaintiff was the State of Alaska rather than an environmental group?</li>

            <h4>Approaching Administrative Law Exams</h4>

            <p>Administrative law exams typically present complex fact patterns that raise multiple issues across various doctrines. Success requires not only knowing the substantive law but also recognizing which issues to address and in what order. This section provides a structured approach for analyzing administrative law questions.</p>

            <div class="test-box">
                <h4>General Approach to Admin Law Questions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Identify the Agency Action</strong>: What is the agency doing (or not doing)? Is it rulemaking, adjudication, informal guidance, or something else?</li>
                    <li><strong>Consider Threshold Issues</strong>: Can a court even hear this case?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reviewability (Is the action reviewable or "committed to agency discretion"?)</li>
                            <li>Standing (Does the plaintiff have Article III standing and fall within the zone of interests?)</li>
                            <li>Ripeness (Is the case ready for review or premature?)</li>
                            <li>Finality (Is the agency action "final" under the APA?)</li>
                            <li>Exhaustion (Has the plaintiff exhausted administrative remedies?)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Analyze Procedural Issues</strong>: Did the agency follow proper procedures?
                        <ul>
                            <li>If rulemaking: Were notice-and-comment requirements followed? Was the action exempt?</li>
                            <li>If adjudication: Was formal adjudication required? Were proper procedures followed?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Assess Substantive Issues</strong>: Was the agency's action legally valid?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Constitutional issues (nondelegation, major questions, separation of powers)</li>
                            <li>Statutory interpretation (Skidmore analysis after Loper Bright; whether the agency's interpretation is the best reading of the statute)</li>
                            <li>Arbitrary and capricious review (State Farm factors)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Analyze Potential Remedies</strong>: If the agency action is invalid, what should the court do?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Remand without vacatur vs. vacatur</li>
                            <li>Nationwide injunction vs. as-applied relief</li>
                        </ul>
