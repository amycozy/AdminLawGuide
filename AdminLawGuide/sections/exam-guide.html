                        <p>Under APA § 701(a)(2), agency action is "committed to agency discretion by law" when the statute provides no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency's exercise of discretion.

                            <p>When confronted with an agency's interpretation of a statute, I would help courts apply a two-step analysis:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Step One:</strong> Has Congress directly spoken to the precise question at issue? If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter.</li>
                                <li><strong>Step Two:</strong> If the statute is ambiguous, is the agency's interpretation reasonable?</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>But remember, after <em>Loper Bright Fisheries v. Raimondo</em> (2024), courts no longer follow this framework and instead determine the best interpretation of the statute using traditional tools of statutory construction.</p>

                        In <strong>West Virginia v. EPA</strong>, the Supreme Court invoked the Major Questions Doctrine to strike down the EPA's Clean Power Plan. The Court held that when an agency claims to discover in a long-extant statute an unheralded power to regulate a significant portion of the economy, it must point to clear congressional authorization.

        <div class="interactive-element">
            <h4>Scenario 1: Agency Authority</h4>
            <p>The Department of Transportation (DOT) issues a rule requiring all smartphone manufacturers to include a feature that automatically disables text messaging capabilities when a phone is detected moving faster than 10 mph. The DOT claims authority under a statute that authorizes it to "issue regulations to enhance highway safety." Several technology companies challenge the rule.</p>
            <div class="scenario-question">
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> What doctrine(s) would you analyze to determine if DOT has the authority to issue this rule?</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Major Questions Doctrine:</strong> This is likely a question of vast economic and political significance, as it would impact every smartphone manufacturer and user in the country. Under this doctrine, the court would look for clear congressional authorization for DOT to regulate smartphone functionality.</li>
                        <li><strong>Statutory Authority:</strong> Does the broad language "enhance highway safety" clearly authorize regulation of smartphone manufacturing, which is not traditionally within DOT's regulatory sphere?</li>
                        <li><strong>Nondelegation Concerns:</strong> Is "enhance highway safety" an intelligible principle sufficient to guide the agency's discretion for this type of regulation?</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Given recent Supreme Court cases like West Virginia v. EPA, a court would likely find that Congress did not clearly authorize DOT to impose design requirements on smartphones, even if the purpose relates to highway safety.</p>

            <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issues a final rule reducing the permissible levels of a certain air pollutant from industrial sources. In its rulemaking, the EPA discusses the health benefits of the regulation but doesn't address industry concerns about technological feasibility or economic impacts raised during the comment period. An industry group challenges the rule as arbitrary and capricious.</p>

                    <p>Under Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association v. State Farm, a court would likely find this rule arbitrary and capricious because:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The EPA failed to consider an important aspect of the problem (technological feasibility and economic impacts)</li>

                        <li>The agency's explanation is incomplete, as it addresses only the benefits without considering the costs or implementation challenges</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The court would likely remand to the agency to address these deficiencies in the rulemaking process, requiring the EPA to consider and respond to the industry concerns before finalizing the rule.</p>

            <h4>Hypothetical 1: Major Questions Doctrine</h4>
            <p><strong>Facts:</strong> The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issues a rule requiring all social media platforms with more than 10 million users to implement content moderation policies that remove false or misleading information within 24 hours. The FCC relies on a provision in its organic statute authorizing it to "make such rules and regulations... as may be necessary in the execution of its functions."

            <ol>

            <h4>Hypothetical 2: Standing</h4>
            <p><strong>Facts:</strong> The Department of the Interior (DOI) lifts a ban on oil and gas leasing in a national wildlife refuge in Alaska. An environmental group whose members visit the refuge occasionally for bird-watching challenges the decision. The group argues that oil and gas development will harm wildlife and reduce their members' enjoyment of the area. DOI argues that the plaintiffs lack standing because development hasn't started yet and may never affect the specific areas the members visit.</p>
            <p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

An association of small online businesses challenges the rule.</p>

The document states that the DOT "expects" all automobile manufacturers to include new anti-collision technology in vehicles by next year, though it "will consider the totality of circumstances" in enforcement actions.

                            <ul>
                                <li>Does it create new rights or obligations? The expectation of new technology installation seems to create a new obligation.</li>
                                <li>Does it amend or effectively amend a prior legislative rule? Unclear from the facts.</li>
                                <li>Does it bind the agency or regulated parties? The "expects" language suggests binding effect, though "totality of circumstances" provides some flexibility.</li>

                        </li>

                                <li><em>Policy Statement?</em> Policy statements must genuinely preserve agency discretion and not impose binding norms. The "expects" language suggests binding effect, but "totality of circumstances" creates ambiguity.</li>
                                <li><em>Interpretive Rule?</em> Interpretive rules explain existing legal obligations rather than creating new ones. The anti-collision technology requirement appears to be new, not an interpretation of existing obligations.</li>

                    <p><em>Analysis:</em> Courts use various tests to distinguish policy statements from legislative rules:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Binding Effect Test:</strong> Does the agency treat the document as binding in practice?</li>

                        <li><strong>Agency Characterization:</strong> How does the agency characterize the document? (Least important factor)</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The use of mandatory language ("expects") suggests a binding norm, not a genuine policy statement.</li>
                        <li>The requirement to include new technology would have substantial impacts on manufacturers (likely costly).</li>
                        <li>The vague "totality of circumstances" language may be insufficient to preserve true discretion, especially if the practical effect creates a de facto requirement.</li>
                        <li>Calling the document "guidance" is not determinative if its practical effect is binding.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><em>Conclusion:</em> The document is likely a legislative rule disguised as guidance. It appears to establish a new binding norm with significant practical consequences, requiring manufacturers to install specific technology. The DOT should have used notice and comment procedures under APA § 553. A court would likely set aside the rule as procedurally defective.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) publishes a document titled "Clarification of Greenhouse Gas Regulation" that expands the definition of "stationary source" to include previously unregulated small businesses. The document was issued without notice and comment procedures, with the EPA claiming it was merely an interpretive rule. The expanded definition would require thousands of small businesses to obtain costly permits. The rule is challenged by a coalition of small business owners two years after its publication. The EPA Administrator who issued the rule was appointed by the President as a "recess appointment" during a three-day Senate break.

                        <li><strong>Injury in Fact:</strong> 
                            <ul>
                                <li>The claimed injuries are aesthetic and recreational interests in observing wildlife.</li>
                                <li>Such interests can qualify as cognizable injuries under Lujan and Sierra Club v. Morton.</li>
                                <li>However, the lack of concrete plans to visit the refuge in the next year makes the injury speculative rather than "actual or imminent" as required by Lujan.</li>
                                <li>The distance of 20 miles between drilling sites and public access areas further weakens the concreteness and particularization of the injury.</li>
                                <li>Under Summers v. Earth Island Institute, a mere "someday" intention to visit is insufficient.</li>

                                <li>The causal connection between drilling 20 miles away and harm to bird watching opportunities is attenuated.</li>
                                <li>The organization would need scientific evidence showing how drilling would impact wildlife throughout the refuge.</li>
                                <li>Without such evidence, causation may be too speculative to satisfy Article III requirements.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>If permits were invalidated, drilling would not occur, which would redress the alleged injury.</li>
                                <li>This element is likely satisfied.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <li><strong>Organizational Standing:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Under Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Commission, an organization needs at least one member with standing to sue in their own right.</li>
                                <li>Given the weaknesses in individual standing, organizational standing is problematic.</li>

                                <li>Environmental and recreational interests are generally within the zone of interests of statutes governing national wildlife refuges.</li>
                                <li>This prudential standing requirement would likely be satisfied.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> A court would likely find that the organization lacks standing primarily due to insufficient injury in fact. Without members who have concrete plans to visit the refuge, the injury remains too speculative and fails the "actual or imminent" requirement under Lujan. The organization could potentially establish standing by identifying members with specific, planned visits to the refuge or by gathering scientific evidence showing how drilling 20 miles away would concretely impact the entire ecosystem visitors experience.</p>

                    <p>This problem tests basic understanding of the distinction between legislative rules and interpretive rules/policy statements:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Legislative Rule Indicators:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The document uses binding language ("must" and "must not") rather than suggestive language.</li>
                                <li>It appears to establish substantive requirements for organic certification, not merely explain existing requirements.</li>
                                <li>The title "Guidance" is not determinative; courts look to actual content and effect.</li>

                                <li>An interpretive rule explains existing legal obligations without creating new ones.</li>
                                <li>If the pesticide requirements already exist in statutes or regulations, the document could be interpretive.</li>
                                <li>However, the problem suggests these are new requirements, not interpretations of existing ones.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Policy Statement Analysis:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A policy statement must genuinely preserve agency discretion and not impose binding norms.</li>
                                <li>The mandatory language ("must"/"must not") suggests a binding effect, not a tentative policy.</li>
                                <li>There is no indication of preserved discretion in applying these requirements.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The document is likely a legislative rule requiring notice and comment. The mandatory language creates binding legal obligations rather than interpreting existing ones. Under cases like Appalachian Power v. EPA, courts look beyond agency labels to the practical binding effect. The USDA should have used notice and comment procedures under APA § 553.</p>

                <p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issues a rule requiring all internet service providers (ISPs) to provide a minimum of 100 Mbps download speeds to all customers by 2026. The rule is estimated to cost the industry $50 billion in infrastructure upgrades. The FCC cites its authority under the Communications Act to "make available... a rapid, efficient, nationwide... communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges."

                                <li>The rule has vast economic significance ($50 billion cost to industry).</li>
                                <li>It represents a major transformation of the internet service market.</li>
                                <li>Under West Virginia v. EPA, courts expect clear congressional authorization for such significant regulatory actions.</li>
                                <li>The general language about "rapid, efficient, nationwide... communication service" lacks the specificity typically required for major questions.</li>

                        </li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Without Chevron deference, the court must determine the best reading of the statute using traditional tools of interpretation.</li>
                                <li>Text: Does "rapid, efficient" communication service authorize mandating specific speed minimums?</li>
                                <li>The term "rapid" is relative and subjective, not clearly authorizing a specific numerical requirement.</li>
                                <li>Context: The phrase "with adequate facilities at reasonable charges" suggests a balance between quality and cost, not a singular focus on speed.</li>
                                <li>Purpose: While promoting better communication services is a purpose of the Act, the statute also aims to maintain reasonable costs.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                                <li>The rule potentially intrudes on areas traditionally regulated by states.</li>
                                <li>Under Gregory v. Ashcroft, courts expect clear statements from Congress before interpreting statutes to alter federal-state balance.</li>

                    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The FCC likely lacks statutory authority for this specific rule. Under the Major Questions Doctrine, the general language about "rapid, efficient" service is insufficient to authorize a $50 billion nationwide speed mandate. Post-Loper Bright, without Chevron deference, the best reading of the statute does not support such a specific numerical requirement. A more tailored approach with flexible standards or one that accounts for regional differences would have a stronger statutory basis.</p>

                                <li>Did the SEC examine relevant data on costs and benefits?</li>

                    <p><strong>Most Likely to Succeed:</strong> The Major Questions Doctrine challenge is most likely to succeed. Given the $3.9 billion cost and the significant policy implications of mandatory climate disclosures, courts would expect clear congressional authorization. The SEC's general disclosure authority would likely be deemed insufficient for such a major economic and political question. Additionally, the logical outgrowth challenge is strong if the final rule contains significant provisions not reasonably foreseeable from the proposed rule.</p>

                <h6>Agency Design and Authority Exercise</h6>
                <p>Congress creates a new federal agency, the Digital Privacy Commission (DPC), with a novel structure: five commissioners, each serving 10-year terms, removable by the President only for "neglect of duty or malfeasance." The commissioners may only be removed by a majority vote of the other commissioners, confirmed by the President. The DPC is authorized to "protect consumer privacy in the digital domain" and may impose civil penalties up to $500,000 per violation. Its funding comes directly from the penalties it collects, not congressional appropriations.</p>
                <p>The DPC issues a rule requiring all technology companies to obtain affirmative consent from users before collecting any data, with a complex set of requirements for what constitutes valid consent. The rule is expected to cost the technology sector $25 billion annually to implement. A technology industry association challenges the DPC's structure and the rule.</p>

                                <li>The dual layer of removal protection (commissioners can only be removed by other commissioners, who themselves have for-cause protection) likely violates Article II.</li>
                                <li>Under Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB (2010), dual for-cause removal restrictions impermissibly insulate officers from presidential control.</li>

                                <li>By funding the DPC through penalties it collects rather than congressional appropriations, the structure diminishes both congressional and presidential oversight.</li>

                    <p><strong>Most Serious Issues:</strong> The constitutional problems are severe. The dual-layer removal restrictions almost certainly violate Article II under Free Enterprise Fund, while the self-funding mechanism raises serious Appropriations Clause concerns. On the statutory side, the Major Questions Doctrine provides a strong challenge to the substantive rule given its enormous economic impact and the vague statutory authorization.</p>
                    <p><strong>Likely Outcome:</strong> A court would likely find at least the removal restrictions unconstitutional, but might sever these provisions while leaving the agency intact. The substantive rule would likely be invalidated under the Major Questions Doctrine. The funding mechanism presents a novel question that could go either way, though recent trends suggest courts might view such congressional bypassing with skepticism.</p>

                <h6>Interlocking Doctrines Exercise</h6>
                <p>The Department of Energy (DOE) issues a rule requiring power plants nationwide to capture 90% of their carbon emissions, citing authority under a provision of the Clean Air Act that authorizes the agency to establish "the best system of emission reduction" for existing sources. The rule would effectively require all coal plants to implement carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology at a cost of approximately $20 billion. Three months after the final rule is published, a coalition of energy companies and several states challenge the rule. During litigation, the DOE publishes a new document titled "Implementation Guidance" that changes several key compliance dates and creates new exemptions for certain facilities "facing economic hardship." The guidance is issued without notice and comment procedures. The challengers amend their complaint to include challenges to the guidance document.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>The CCS mandate has vast economic significance ($20 billion cost) and transforms the power generation sector.</li>
                                <li>The authority to determine "the best system of emission reduction" is a general provision that likely lacks the clear congressional authorization required for such a transformative rule.</li>
                                <li>Following West Virginia v. EPA (which involved similar EPA regulations of power plants), the DOE likely lacks statutory authority for this specific mandate.</li>
                                <li>Post-Loper Bright, without Chevron deference, the court would determine if this is the best reading of the statutory text using traditional tools of interpretation.</li>

                                <li>The challenge is brought within three months, well within any applicable statute of limitations.</li>
                                <li>The final rule is clearly a consummated agency action with legal consequences, thus the challenge is ripe for review.</li>
                                <li>For the "Implementation Guidance," courts would need to determine if it constitutes final agency action under the Bennett v. Spear test.</li>

                                <li>Energy companies face direct compliance costs, satisfying injury, causation, and redressability requirements for Article III standing.</li>
                                <li>States likely have parens patriae standing to protect economic interests within their borders and may also have proprietary standing if they own any affected facilities.</li>
                                <li>States may also claim procedural injury from failure to follow proper rulemaking procedures.</li>

                                <li>These modifications have substantive legal effect rather than merely interpreting existing requirements.</li>
                                <li>Under cases like Appalachian Power v. EPA, guidance documents that effectively amend legislative rules require notice and comment.</li>

                                <li>The nationwide mandate implicates federalism concerns by potentially displacing traditional state authority over energy production.</li>
                                <li>Under the Clean Air Act's cooperative federalism structure, states typically implement federal standards with significant flexibility.</li>
                                <li>The direct federal mandate may conflict with this cooperative scheme.</li>

                                <li>The agency would need to demonstrate that CCS technology is genuinely "adequately demonstrated" and economically feasible.</li>
                                <li>The rule must consider important aspects of the problem, including reliability concerns, regional differences, and economic impacts.</li>
                                <li>The sudden introduction of "economic hardship" exemptions suggests the original rule may have failed to adequately consider these factors.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Doctrinal Interactions:</strong> This complex scenario demonstrates how multiple administrative law doctrines interact in challenging agency action. The threshold issues (standing, ripeness, finality) must be satisfied before courts will consider the merits. On the merits, the statutory authority question (particularly through the Major Questions Doctrine lens) would likely be dispositive in light of West Virginia v. EPA. The procedural challenge to the guidance document represents a separate avenue for invalidation. Even if statutory authority existed, the rule would face rigorous arbitrary and capricious review.</p>
                    <p><strong>Likely Outcome:</strong> Following West Virginia v. EPA, a court would almost certainly find the rule exceeds the DOE's statutory authority under the Major Questions Doctrine. Additionally, the "Implementation Guidance" would likely be deemed a legislative rule requiring notice and comment. The agency's attempt to modify compliance requirements through guidance suggests potential arbitrary and capricious issues with the underlying rule as well.</p>

                            </ul>

                            <ul>
                                <li>The court examines whether the CPSC has statutory authority for its testing requirements.</li>
                                <li>Key Issue: Does the statute authorize mandatory third-party testing for these specific chemicals?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Court Decision:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The court would likely find the final rule arbitrary and capricious with respect to the 5 contested chemicals.</li>
                                <li>Key Issue: Should the court vacate the entire rule or only the portions related to the 5 contested chemicals?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Remedy & Remand:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The court would likely remand to the agency to provide a more reasoned explanation or reconsider the requirements for the 5 chemicals.</li>
                                <li>Key Issue: Will the court vacate the rule during remand or leave it in effect?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Agency Response to Remand:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The CPSC might: (1) Better explain its rejection of the industry studies; (2) Modify the rule to exclude some chemicals; or (3) Conduct additional scientific review.</li>
                                <li>Key Issue: If the CPSC makes significant changes, would a new notice and comment period be required?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Likely Outcome:</strong> The court would likely find the CPSC's cursory dismissal of scientific studies arbitrary and capricious under State Farm, which requires agencies to examine relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for their actions. The court would almost certainly remand for further explanation or reconsideration of the 5 contested chemicals. The court might sever and uphold the requirements for the 15 uncontested chemicals while vacating the requirements for the 5 contested chemicals.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key Administrative Law Principles Illustrated:</strong> This scenario demonstrates the importance of reasoned agency decision-making, the requirement to respond meaningfully to significant comments, and how courts enforce these requirements through arbitrary and capricious review. It also illustrates the court's remedial flexibility in administrative law cases.</p>

            <h5 class="icon-legislative">Policy Tension Resolution</h5>
            <p>Administrative law involves balancing competing policy concerns like expertise, democratic accountability, efficiency, and rights protection. These exercises explore how these tensions manifest in concrete cases.</p>
            
            <div class="interactive-element">
                <h6>Expertise vs. Democratic Accountability</h6>
                <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issues a rule establishing stringent air quality standards based on complex scientific studies about the health effects of particulate matter. The rule is projected to save thousands of lives annually but will cost certain industries billions of dollars to implement. During the previous administration, the EPA had proposed but not finalized much less stringent standards based on different scientific models. The new administration explicitly cites policy priorities of environmental protection and climate change mitigation as factors in its decision. Industry groups challenge the rule, arguing the EPA inappropriately considered political factors rather than making a purely scientific determination.</p>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> How should courts balance agency expertise with democratic accountability through the political branches? What legal standards apply?</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Tension Between Expertise and Politics:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Administrative agencies embody a tension: they are expert bodies with technical knowledge, but also part of the executive branch subject to presidential policy direction.</li>
                                <li>Pure technocracy would ignore democratic accountability; pure politics would undermine expertise-based decision-making.</li>
                                <li>The tension is particularly acute in science-based regulations with significant policy implications.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Supreme Court Guidance on the Balance:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>In State Farm, the Court suggested that purely political considerations cannot justify regulatory action without reasoned explanation.</li>
                                <li>However, in Fox Television, Justice Scalia noted that a change in administration and its policy priorities is a permissible basis for regulatory change, so long as the agency acknowledges the change and provides good reasons.</li>
                                <li>Massachusetts v. EPA clarified that while agencies have discretion, they must ground decisions in the statutory criteria, not extra-statutory policy considerations.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Application to the EPA Air Quality Standards:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The Clean Air Act typically requires the EPA to set air quality standards based on public health considerations with an "adequate margin of safety," not economic costs.</li>
                                <li>If the EPA explicitly relied on climate change policy (not specifically mentioned in the relevant CAA provisions), this could be problematic.</li>
                                <li>However, if the agency based its decision on scientific evidence about health effects while acknowledging that the administration's priorities influenced its approach to uncertainty in the evidence, this would likely be permissible.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Key Legal Standards:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The EPA must demonstrate that its standards are based on the statutory criteria (health effects) and supported by substantial evidence.</li>
                                <li>The agency must explain why it chose its approach over alternatives, including the previous administration's proposed standards.</li>
                                <li>If scientific evidence could support multiple conclusions, the agency may choose among reasonable alternatives, but must explain its reasoning.</li>
                                <li>If relying on new scientific studies, the agency must explain why these studies warrant a different outcome.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Proper vs. Improper Political Considerations:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Proper: Acknowledging administration priorities influenced how the agency weighed uncertain scientific evidence or exercised discretion within statutory bounds.</li>
                                <li>Improper: Basing the decision on factors not contemplated by the statute or ignoring relevant scientific evidence for political reasons.</li>
                                <li>The distinction is often subtle but crucial for judicial review.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Resolution Framework:</strong> Courts should apply a balanced approach that acknowledges the legitimacy of political direction while ensuring agencies adhere to statutory mandates and reasoned decision-making:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Examine whether the agency based its decision on factors that Congress intended it to consider in the authorizing statute.</li>
                        <li>Review whether the agency examined the relevant scientific data and articulated a satisfactory explanation connecting that data to its conclusion.</li>
                        <li>Acknowledge that when scientific evidence permits multiple reasonable interpretations, the administration's policy preferences may legitimately influence which reasonable interpretation the agency adopts.</li>
                        <li>Require transparency about the role of policy considerations in the decision-making process.</li>
                        <li>Ensure the agency properly explained any change in position from the previous administration.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Likely Outcome:</strong> If the EPA transparently explained its scientific basis while acknowledging policy considerations influenced its approach within statutory bounds, a court would likely uphold the rule. However, if the EPA explicitly relied on climate change considerations not contemplated by the Clean Air Act's national ambient air quality standards provisions, or if it failed to adequately explain its departure from the previous administration's approach, a court might find the decision arbitrary and capricious.</p>

                <h6>Novel Agency Design Challenge</h6>
                <p>Congress creates the Emerging Technologies Commission (ETC) with a unique structure and authority. The ETC has seven commissioners: three appointed by the President with Senate confirmation, two appointed directly by the Speaker of the House, and two appointed directly by the Senate Majority Leader. Commissioners serve 8-year terms and can only be removed for "gross misconduct" by a supermajority vote of the commission itself. The ETC has authority to regulate "emerging technologies that pose significant risks to national security or public welfare," with power to ban technologies, mandate safety features, or impose operational restrictions. Its funding comes from a dedicated tax on technology companies based on their market capitalization. The ETC issues a rule requiring all artificial intelligence systems above a certain capability threshold to include monitoring features allowing government oversight of training processes and internal operations. The rule also prohibits deployment of certain AI capabilities deemed "high risk." A technology company challenges both the ETC's structure and its AI rule.</p>

                                <li>The appointment of commissioners directly by the Speaker and Senate Majority Leader clearly violates the Appointments Clause.</li>
                                <li>Under Buckley v. Valeo and subsequent cases, principal officers must be appointed by the President with Senate confirmation.</li>
                                <li>Even if commissioners were deemed inferior officers (unlikely given their authority and tenure), they would still need to be appointed by the President, department heads, or courts of law, not by legislators.</li>

                                <li>The self-removal mechanism (commission supermajority vote) contravenes the President's Article II authority.</li>
                                <li>Under Free Enterprise Fund, multiple layers of removal protection are unconstitutional.</li>
                                <li>The "gross misconduct" standard imposes a higher removal threshold than the typical "inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance" standard upheld for independent agencies.</li>

                                <li>This structure gives Congress control over executive functions, contrary to Bowsher v. Synar's prohibition on congressional control over execution of laws.</li>

                                <li>The statute provides minimal guidance on what constitutes "significant risks."</li>
                                <li>While the Supreme Court has rarely invalidated statutes on nondelegation grounds, this broad delegation may be vulnerable under recent judicial skepticism.</li>

                                <li>The ETC would need clear congressional authorization for such sweeping regulation.</li>
                                <li>The general authority over "emerging technologies" likely lacks the specificity required under West Virginia v. EPA.</li>

                                <li>Government monitoring of AI systems may implicate First Amendment concerns, particularly if AI systems generate speech or expression.</li>
                                <li>Prohibition on certain AI capabilities could restrict development of tools for artistic, journalistic, or expressive purposes.</li>

                                <li>Mandatory monitoring features allowing government oversight may constitute warrantless surveillance.</li>
                                <li>The rule would need to address Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Likely Outcome:</strong> The ETC's structure is clearly unconstitutional on multiple grounds, most obviously the Appointments Clause violation through legislative appointment of executive officers. A court would almost certainly invalidate the agency's structure. The AI regulation would likely fall as a result, though even if considered separately, it would face serious Major Questions Doctrine challenges, as the sweeping regulation of AI technology would require clear congressional authorization.</p>
                    <p><strong>Severability Questions:</strong> A key question would be whether the unconstitutional structural provisions are severable from the rest of the statute. Given the fundamental nature of the Appointments Clause violation and its centrality to the agency's design, a court would likely find the entire agency structure inseverable and invalid. Even if the structural provisions were somehow severable, the AI rule would likely exceed the agency's statutory authority under the Major Questions Doctrine.</p>

            <h4>Approaching Administrative Law Exams</h4>

            <p>Administrative law exams typically present complex fact patterns that raise multiple issues across various doctrines. Success requires not only knowing the substantive law but also recognizing which issues to address and in what order. This section provides a structured approach for analyzing administrative law questions.</p>

            <div class="test-box">
                <h4>General Approach to Admin Law Questions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Identify the Agency Action</strong>: What is the agency doing (or not doing)? Is it rulemaking, adjudication, informal guidance, or something else?</li>
                    <li><strong>Consider Threshold Issues</strong>: Can a court even hear this case?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reviewability (Is the action reviewable or "committed to agency discretion"?)</li>
                            <li>Standing (Does the plaintiff have Article III standing and fall within the zone of interests?)</li>
                            <li>Ripeness (Is the case ready for review or premature?)</li>
                            <li>Finality (Is the agency action "final" under the APA?)</li>
                            <li>Exhaustion (Has the plaintiff exhausted administrative remedies?)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Analyze Procedural Issues</strong>: Did the agency follow proper procedures?
                        <ul>
                            <li>If rulemaking: Were notice-and-comment requirements followed? Was the action exempt?</li>
                            <li>If adjudication: Was formal adjudication required? Were proper procedures followed?</li>
                        </ul>

            <p>Administrative law exams typically present complex fact patterns that raise multiple issues across various doctrines. Success requires not only knowing the substantive law but also recognizing which issues to address and in what order. This section provides a structured approach for analyzing administrative law questions.</p>

            <div class="test-box">
                <h6>General Approach to Admin Law Questions</h6>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Identify the Agency Action</strong>: What is the agency doing (or not doing)? Is it rulemaking, adjudication, informal guidance, or something else?</li>
                    <li><strong>Consider Threshold Issues</strong>: Can a court even hear this case?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reviewability (Is the action reviewable or "committed to agency discretion"?)</li>
                            <li>Standing (Does the plaintiff have Article III standing and fall within the zone of interests?)</li>
                            <li>Ripeness (Is the case ready for review or premature?)</li>
                            <li>Finality (Is the agency action "final" under the APA?)</li>
                            <li>Exhaustion (Has the plaintiff exhausted administrative remedies?)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Analyze Procedural Issues</strong>: Did the agency follow proper procedures?
                        <ul>
                            <li>If rulemaking: Were notice-and-comment requirements followed? Was the action exempt?</li>
                            <li>If adjudication: Was formal adjudication required? Were proper procedures followed?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Assess Substantive Issues</strong>: Was the agency's action legally valid?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Constitutional issues (nondelegation, major questions, separation of powers)</li>
                            <li>Statutory interpretation (Skidmore analysis after Loper Bright; whether the agency's interpretation is the best reading of the statute)</li>
                            <li>Arbitrary and capricious review (State Farm factors)</li>

                    <li><strong>Analyze Potential Remedies</strong>: If the agency action is invalid, what should the court do?

            <div class="key-point">
                <h6>Hypothetical 1: Major Questions Doctrine</h6>
                <p><strong>Facts:</strong> The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issues a rule requiring all social media platforms with more than 10 million users to implement content moderation policies that remove false or misleading information within 24 hours. The FCC relies on a provision in its organic statute authorizing it to "make such rules and regulations... as may be necessary in the execution of its functions." Several tech companies challenge the rule.</p>
                <p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Would the Major Questions Doctrine apply to this agency action? Why or why not?</li>
                    <li>How would the factors from <span class="case-name">West Virginia v. EPA</span> apply?</li>
                    <li>Would your analysis change if Congress had specifically authorized the FCC to "regulate social media platforms to prevent the spread of misinformation"?</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="key-point">
                <h6>Hypothetical 2: Arbitrary and Capricious Review</h6>
                <p><strong>Facts:</strong> The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issues a rule requiring warning labels on high-sugar beverages. The rule applies to sodas but exempts flavored coffee drinks and fruit juices, even though they often contain comparable amounts of sugar. In the rule's statement of basis and purpose, the FDA states that "sugary beverages pose health risks" but doesn't address why coffee drinks and fruit juices are exempt. A soda manufacturer challenges the rule as arbitrary and capricious.</p>
                <p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>What arguments would the soda manufacturer make under <span class="case-name">State Farm</span>?</li>
                    <li>Would the FDA's rule likely be upheld or invalidated? Why?</li>
                    <li>What could the FDA have done differently to strengthen its rule against challenge?</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="key-point">
                <h6>Hypothetical 3: Standing</h6>
                <p><strong>Facts:</strong> The Department of the Interior (DOI) lifts a ban on oil and gas leasing in a national wildlife refuge in Alaska. An environmental group whose members visit the refuge occasionally for bird-watching challenges the decision. The group argues that oil and gas development will harm wildlife and reduce their members' enjoyment of the area. DOI argues that the plaintiffs lack standing because development hasn't started yet and may never affect the specific areas the members visit.</p>
                <p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Do the environmental group's members have standing under <span class="case-name">Lujan</span>? Why or why not?</li>
                    <li>How might the plaintiffs strengthen their standing arguments?</li>
                    <li>Would the analysis change if the plaintiff was the State of Alaska rather than an environmental group?</li>

            <div class="key-point">
                <h6>Hypothetical 4: Post-Loper Bright Statutory Interpretation</h6>
                <p><strong>Facts:</strong> The Clean Water Act prohibits discharge of pollutants into "navigable waters," defined as "waters of the United States." The EPA and Army Corps of Engineers issue a rule interpreting this phrase to include wetlands with a "significant nexus" to traditionally navigable waters. A developer who wants to build on wetlands challenges the rule, arguing that "waters of the United States" should be limited to permanent, standing, or flowing bodies of water.</p>
                <p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>How would a court analyze this challenge after <span class="case-name">Loper Bright</span>?</li>
                    <li>What traditional tools of statutory interpretation would be relevant?</li>
                    <li>What role would the agencies' expertise play in the court's analysis?</li>
