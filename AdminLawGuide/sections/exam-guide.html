                        <p>Under APA § 701(a)(2), agency action is "committed to agency discretion by law" when the statute provides no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency's exercise of discretion.

                        <li><strong>Major Questions Doctrine:</strong> This is likely a question of vast economic and political significance, as it would impact every smartphone manufacturer and user in the country. Under this doctrine, the court would look for clear congressional authorization for DOT to regulate smartphone functionality.</li>
                        <li><strong>Statutory Authority:</strong> Does the broad language "enhance highway safety" clearly authorize regulation of smartphone manufacturing, which is not traditionally within DOT's regulatory sphere?</li>
                        <li><strong>Nondelegation Concerns:</strong> Is "enhance highway safety" an intelligible principle sufficient to guide the agency's discretion for this type of regulation?</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Given recent Supreme Court cases like West Virginia v. EPA, a court would likely find that Congress did not clearly authorize DOT to impose design requirements on smartphones, even if the purpose relates to highway safety.</p>

            <h4>Scenario 2: Arbitrary and Capricious Review</h4>
            <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issues a final rule reducing the permissible levels of a certain air pollutant from industrial sources. In its rulemaking, the EPA discusses the health benefits of the regulation but doesn't address industry concerns about technological feasibility or economic impacts raised during the comment period. An industry group challenges the rule as arbitrary and capricious.</p>

                    <p>Under Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association v. State Farm, a court would likely find this rule arbitrary and capricious because:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The EPA failed to consider an important aspect of the problem (technological feasibility and economic impacts)</li>
                        <li>The agency did not respond to significant comments raised during the notice-and-comment period</li>
                        <li>The agency's explanation is incomplete, as it addresses only the benefits without considering the costs or implementation challenges</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The court would likely remand to the agency to address these deficiencies in the rulemaking process, requiring the EPA to consider and respond to the industry concerns before finalizing the rule.</p>

            <h4>Hypothetical 1: Major Questions Doctrine</h4>
            <p><strong>Facts:</strong> The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issues a rule requiring all social media platforms with more than 10 million users to implement content moderation policies that remove false or misleading information within 24 hours. The FCC relies on a provision in its organic statute authorizing it to "make such rules and regulations... as may be necessary in the execution of its functions."

An environmental group whose members visit the refuge occasionally for bird-watching challenges the decision.

            <h4>Approaching Administrative Law Exams</h4>

            <p>Administrative law exams typically present complex fact patterns that raise multiple issues across various doctrines. Success requires not only knowing the substantive law but also recognizing which issues to address and in what order. This section provides a structured approach for analyzing administrative law questions.</p>

            <div class="test-box">
                <h4>General Approach to Admin Law Questions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Identify the Agency Action</strong>: What is the agency doing (or not doing)? Is it rulemaking, adjudication, informal guidance, or something else?</li>
                    <li><strong>Consider Threshold Issues</strong>: Can a court even hear this case?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reviewability (Is the action reviewable or "committed to agency discretion"?)</li>
                            <li>Standing (Does the plaintiff have Article III standing and fall within the zone of interests?)</li>
                            <li>Ripeness (Is the case ready for review or premature?)</li>
                            <li>Finality (Is the agency action "final" under the APA?)</li>
                            <li>Exhaustion (Has the plaintiff exhausted administrative remedies?)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Analyze Procedural Issues</strong>: Did the agency follow proper procedures?
                        <ul>
                            <li>If rulemaking: Were notice-and-comment requirements followed? Was the action exempt?</li>
                            <li>If adjudication: Was formal adjudication required? Were proper procedures followed?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Assess Substantive Issues</strong>: Was the agency's action legally valid?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Constitutional issues (nondelegation, major questions, separation of powers)</li>
                            <li>Statutory interpretation (Skidmore analysis after Loper Bright; whether the agency's interpretation is the best reading of the statute)</li>
                            <li>Arbitrary and capricious review (State Farm factors)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Analyze Potential Remedies</strong>: If the agency action is invalid, what should the court do?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Remand without vacatur vs. vacatur</li>
                            <li>Nationwide injunction vs. as-applied relief</li>
