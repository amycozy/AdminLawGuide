    <h3>Scope of Judicial Review</h3>
    
    <p>The Administrative Procedure Act provides the primary framework for judicial review of agency actions in § 706. This section establishes the standards that courts apply when reviewing agency decisions, from deferential standards like "arbitrary and capricious" to more stringent review for certain legal and factual determinations.</p>
    
    <div class="statute-box">
        <h4>APA § 706: Scope of Review</h4>
        <p>The reviewing court shall:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed; and</li>
            <li>Hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be:
                <ol type="A">
                    <li>Arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;</li>
                    <li>Contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity;</li>
                    <li>In excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right;</li>
                    <li>Without observance of procedure required by law;</li>
                    <li>Unsupported by substantial evidence in a case subject to sections 556 and 557 or otherwise reviewed on the record of an agency hearing provided by statute; or</li>
                    <li>Unwarranted by the facts to the extent that the facts are subject to trial de novo by the reviewing court.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In making the foregoing determinations, the court shall review the whole record or those parts of it cited by a party, and due account shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial error.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="judicial-box">
        <h4>Key Principles of Judicial Review</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Record Review</strong>: Courts generally limit their review to the administrative record that was before the agency at the time of its decision</li>
            <li><strong>No De Novo Review</strong>: Courts do not typically substitute their judgment for the agency's, particularly on factual and policy questions</li>
            <li><strong>Different Standards</strong>: The standard of review varies depending on the type of agency action and the nature of the challenge</li>
            <li><strong>Prejudicial Error</strong>: Even if an agency error is found, relief may be denied if the error was harmless</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Substantial Evidence Review</h3>
    
    <p>The "substantial evidence" standard applies to formal agency proceedings conducted under §§ 556 and 557 of the APA or when a statute specifically requires this standard of review. This standard focuses on the factual findings made by the agency.</p>
    
    <div class="case-box">
        <h4 class="case-name">Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB (1951)</h4>

        <div class="case-facts">
            <p>The NLRB found that Universal Camera had fired an employee for giving testimony under the National Labor Relations Act and ordered his reinstatement. This finding contradicted the trial examiner's conclusion that the employee was fired for insubordination. The Second Circuit upheld the Board's decision without considering the examiner's report as part of the record.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-rule">
            <p>The Supreme Court held that courts must consider the whole record, including the hearing examiner's findings, when determining whether an agency's decision is supported by substantial evidence.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-reasoning">
            <p>Justice Frankfurter's opinion established that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Substantial evidence is "more than a mere scintilla" and is "such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion"</li>
                <li>Courts must consider "the record as a whole," including evidence that detracts from the agency's conclusion</li>
                <li>The examiner's findings, while not binding on the agency, are part of the record and must be considered by reviewing courts</li>
                <li>Congress intended the substantial evidence standard to involve more careful scrutiny than courts had previously applied</li>

            <p>Allentown Mack acquired a factory branch and conducted a poll of employees regarding union support after hearing statements from several employees indicating lack of support for the union.

        <div class="case-rule">
            <p>The Supreme Court overturned the NLRB's decision, finding that it was not supported by substantial evidence. The Court criticized the Board for applying a standard that differed from what it purported to apply.</p>

            <p>Justice Scalia's majority opinion:</p>
            <ul>

                <li>Found that Allentown had presented sufficient evidence to establish a reasonable doubt about the union's majority support</li>

    <h3>Arbitrary and Capricious Review</h3>
    
    <p>The "arbitrary and capricious" standard in § 706(2)(A) of the APA applies to all forms of agency action not covered by other standards. This standard has evolved over time, from a highly deferential approach to what is now often called "hard look" review, which requires agencies to articulate clear explanations for their decisions based on relevant factors.</p>
    
    <div class="case-box">
        <h4 class="case-name">Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe (1971)</h4>

        <div class="case-facts">
            <p>The Department of Transportation approved funding for a highway through Overton Park in Memphis. Environmental groups challenged the decision, arguing that the Secretary failed to make the required finding that no "feasible and prudent alternative" existed and failed to adequately consider ways to minimize harm to the park.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-rule">
            <p>The Supreme Court held that the Secretary's decision was subject to judicial review under the APA's arbitrary and capricious standard, which required the Court to determine whether the decision was based on a consideration of relevant factors and whether there was a clear error of judgment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-reasoning">
            <p>Justice Marshall's opinion established that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>While the arbitrary and capricious standard is narrow, it still requires a "thorough, probing, in-depth review"</li>
                <li>Courts must examine whether the agency considered relevant factors and articulated a satisfactory explanation</li>
                <li>Post-hoc rationalizations cannot substitute for contemporaneous agency explanations</li>
                <li>Review must be based on the "whole record" before the agency at the time of the decision</li>

        <div class="case-facts">
            <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) rescinded a rule requiring passive restraints (automatic seatbelts or airbags) in new cars. The agency cited doubts about safety benefits and costs, particularly because it believed most manufacturers would install detachable automatic seatbelts that might not be used.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-rule">
            <p>The Supreme Court held that NHTSA's rescission of the passive restraint rule was arbitrary and capricious because the agency failed to consider obvious alternatives and did not offer a reasoned explanation for its decision.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-reasoning">
            <p>Justice White's majority opinion articulated that under arbitrary and capricious review, an agency must:</p>

                <li>Examine relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action</li>
                <li>Consider all important aspects of the problem</li>

        <h4>The State Farm Test for Arbitrary and Capricious Review</h4>
        <p>Under State Farm, agency action is arbitrary and capricious if the agency:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Relied on factors that Congress did not intend it to consider</li>
            <li>Entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem</li>
            <li>Offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency</li>
            <li>Is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This test has become the cornerstone of modern arbitrary and capricious review, often referred to as "hard look" review because it requires courts to take a "hard look" at the agency's reasoning process.</p>

        <div class="case-facts">
            <p>In response to a petition for rulemaking, the EPA denied a request to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act. The EPA argued that (1) the Clean Air Act did not authorize it to address global climate change, and (2) even if it had authority, it would be unwise to regulate greenhouse gases at that time due to scientific uncertainty and foreign policy considerations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-rule">
            <p>The Supreme Court held that the EPA's denial of the petition was arbitrary and capricious because the agency relied on impermissible considerations outside the statutory text. The Clean Air Act required the EPA to determine whether greenhouse gases "cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare," not to consider policy reasons for declining to regulate.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-reasoning">
            <p>Justice Stevens' majority opinion explained that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Clean Air Act's language is unambiguous regarding the EPA's obligation to regulate harmful air pollutants</li>
                <li>The EPA cannot refuse to regulate based on considerations not mentioned in the statute</li>
                <li>The agency's discretion is limited to determining whether greenhouse gases cause or contribute to air pollution that may endanger public health or welfare</li>
                <li>If the EPA determines that greenhouse gases do endanger public health or welfare, it must regulate them</li>

        <div class="case-rule">
            <p>The Supreme Court declined to overrule <span class="case-name">Auer</span> deference but significantly narrowed its application. Justice Kagan's opinion established a multi-step test for when courts should defer to an agency's interpretation of its own regulations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-reasoning">
            <p>Justice Kagan's majority opinion:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Preserved <span class="case-name">Auer</span> deference but limited it to cases where: (1) the regulation is genuinely ambiguous; (2) the agency's interpretation is reasonable; (3) the interpretation represents the agency's authoritative position; (4) the interpretation implicate's the agency's substantive expertise; and (5) the interpretation reflects the agency's fair and considered judgment</li>
                <li>Emphasized that before deferring, courts must exhaust all traditional tools of interpretation</li>
                <li>Instructed courts not to defer to "convenient litigating positions" or "post hoc rationalizations"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Justice Gorsuch's concurrence (joined by Justice Thomas, Justice Kavanaugh, and Justice Alito) argued that <span class="case-name">Auer</span> deference should be overruled entirely as inconsistent with the APA and separation of powers principles.</p>

    <div class="note">
        <p>The future of <span class="case-name">Auer</span> deference (now <span class="case-name">Kisor</span> deference) for agency interpretations of their own regulations is uncertain following <span class="case-name">Loper Bright</span>. Many of the same arguments that led the Court to overrule <span class="case-name">Chevron</span> could apply equally to <span class="case-name">Auer</span>/<span class="case-name">Kisor</span> deference, suggesting it may be vulnerable to a future challenge.</p>
