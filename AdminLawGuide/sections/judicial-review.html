    <h3>Scope of Judicial Review</h3>
    
    <p>The Administrative Procedure Act provides the primary framework for judicial review of agency actions in § 706. This section establishes the standards that courts apply when reviewing agency decisions, from deferential standards like "arbitrary and capricious" to more stringent review for certain legal and factual determinations.</p>
    
    <div class="statute-box">
        <h4>APA § 706: Scope of Review</h4>
        <p>The reviewing court shall:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed; and</li>
            <li>Hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be:
                <ol type="A">
                    <li>Arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;</li>
                    <li>Contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity;</li>
                    <li>In excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right;</li>
                    <li>Without observance of procedure required by law;</li>
                    <li>Unsupported by substantial evidence in a case subject to sections 556 and 557 or otherwise reviewed on the record of an agency hearing provided by statute; or</li>
                    <li>Unwarranted by the facts to the extent that the facts are subject to trial de novo by the reviewing court.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In making the foregoing determinations, the court shall review the whole record or those parts of it cited by a party, and due account shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial error.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="judicial-box">
        <h4>Key Principles of Judicial Review</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Record Review</strong>: Courts generally limit their review to the administrative record that was before the agency at the time of its decision</li>
            <li><strong>No De Novo Review</strong>: Courts do not typically substitute their judgment for the agency's, particularly on factual and policy questions</li>
            <li><strong>Different Standards</strong>: The standard of review varies depending on the type of agency action and the nature of the challenge</li>
            <li><strong>Prejudicial Error</strong>: Even if an agency error is found, relief may be denied if the error was harmless</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Substantial Evidence Review</h3>
    
    <p>The "substantial evidence" standard applies to formal agency proceedings conducted under §§ 556 and 557 of the APA or when a statute specifically requires this standard of review. This standard focuses on the factual findings made by the agency.</p>

            The Clean Air Act requires "the best system of emission reduction" for power plants. The EPA interprets this to allow regulation based on shifting generation from coal to natural gas and renewables rather than just controlling emissions at individual facilities.

    </div>
    
    <div class="note">
        <p>The overruling of Chevron represents one of the most significant changes in administrative law in decades.

                    <p>A Vietnam War veteran sought retroactive disability benefits based on his PTSD diagnosis. The Department of Veterans Affairs denied his request, interpreting its regulation to require new "relevant" records, which it determined did not include the veteran's psychiatric records. The Federal Circuit deferred to the agency's interpretation under <span class="case-name">Auer v. Robbins</span> (1997), which required deference to an agency's interpretation of its own regulations.</p>

                <div class="case-rule">
                    <p>The Supreme Court declined to overrule <span class="case-name">Auer</span> deference but significantly narrowed its application. Justice Kagan's opinion established a multi-step test for when courts should defer to an agency's interpretation of its own regulations.</p>

                <div class="case-reasoning">
                    <p>Justice Kagan's majority opinion:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Preserved <span class="case-name">Auer</span> deference but limited it to cases where: (1) the regulation is genuinely ambiguous; (2) the agency's interpretation is reasonable; (3) the interpretation represents the agency's authoritative position; (4) the interpretation implicate's the agency's substantive expertise; and (5) the interpretation reflects the agency's fair and considered judgment</li>
                        <li>Emphasized that before deferring, courts must exhaust all traditional tools of interpretation</li>
                        <li>Instructed courts not to defer to "convenient litigating positions" or "post hoc rationalizations"</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Justice Gorsuch's concurrence (joined by Justice Thomas, Justice Kavanaugh, and Justice Alito) argued that <span class="case-name">Auer</span> deference should be overruled entirely as inconsistent with the APA and separation of powers principles.</p>

        <p>The future of <span class="case-name">Auer</span> deference (now <span class="case-name">Kisor</span> deference) for agency interpretations of their own regulations is uncertain following <span class="case-name">Loper Bright</span>. Many of the same arguments that led the Court to overrule <span class="case-name">Chevron</span> could apply equally to <span class="case-name">Auer</span>/<span class="case-name">Kisor</span> deference, suggesting it may be vulnerable to a future challenge.</p>
