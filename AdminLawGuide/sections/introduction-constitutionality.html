    <h3>The Administrative State and Its Constitutional Foundations</h3>
    
    <p>The modern administrative state consists of numerous agencies that perform vital governmental functions. These agencies operate at the intersection of the three traditional branches of government, combining aspects of legislative, executive, and judicial power. This structure raises fundamental questions about the proper allocation of governmental authority under the Constitution.</p>

        <h4>What Do Agencies Do?</h4>
        <p>Administrative agencies serve several critical functions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rulemaking</strong>: Creating regulations with the force of law to implement statutory directives</li>
            <li><strong>Adjudication</strong>: Resolving disputes and enforcing compliance with regulations</li>
            <li><strong>Licensing and Permitting</strong>: Granting permissions for regulated activities</li>
            <li><strong>Investigation and Enforcement</strong>: Monitoring compliance and penalizing violations</li>
            <li><strong>Information Gathering and Dissemination</strong>: Collecting data and issuing guidance</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>Rationales for Administrative Agencies</h4>
        <p>Several justifications support the delegation of authority to administrative agencies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Market Failures</strong>: Addressing externalities, information asymmetries, monopolies, and public goods</li>
            <li><strong>Expertise</strong>: Leveraging specialized knowledge for complex problems</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Responding quickly and adapting to changing conditions</li>
            <li><strong>Collective Values</strong>: Protecting resources and providing services based on shared societal values</li>
            <li><strong>Redistribution</strong>: Implementing policies to increase equality and protect vulnerable populations</li>
            <li><strong>Paternalism</strong>: Implementing policies for public safety and well-being (e.g., "nudges" for safer choices)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p>The case of <span class="case-name">Massachusetts v. EPA</span> (2007) illustrates these principles in action, where the Supreme Court considered the EPA's authority and obligation to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act.</p>
</div>

<div class="explanation" id="nondelegation">
    <h3>The Nondelegation Doctrine</h3>
    
    <p>The nondelegation doctrine stems from Article I of the Constitution, which states that "All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress." This raises a fundamental question: Can Congress delegate its legislative powers to the executive branch (including administrative agencies)?</p>

            <div class="case-facts">
                <p>The National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) authorized the President to approve "codes of fair competition" written by various industries. These codes would then have the force of law. Schechter Poultry was charged with violating the "Live Poultry Code."</p>
            </div>
            <div class="case-rule">
                <p>The Supreme Court unanimously struck down this delegation as unconstitutional, with Justice Cardozo referring to it as "delegation running riot." The Court held that Congress must provide an "intelligible principle" to guide agency discretion.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="case-reasoning">
                <p>The Court found the delegation problematic because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It effectively allowed industry groups to write laws governing themselves</li>
                    <li>The term "fair competition" was too vague and undefined</li>
                    <li>There were insufficient constraints on the President's discretion</li>
                    <li>This amounted to Congress abdication of its lawmaking function</li>

            <div class="case-reasoning">
                <p>Justice Scalia, writing for the Court, explained:</p>

                    <li>The Court has "almost never felt qualified to second-guess Congress regarding the permissible degree of policy judgment that can be left to agencies"</li>

        <div class="case-facts">
            <p>The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) gave the Attorney General authority to "specify the applicability" of registration requirements to pre-Act offenders.</p>

        <div class="case-rule">
            <p>In a fragmented 5-3 decision (with Justice Kavanaugh not participating), the Court upheld the delegation. However, the dissent and separate opinions signaled potential willingness to revive a stronger nondelegation doctrine.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-reasoning">
            <p>Justice Kagan's plurality opinion found that SORNA's delegation was permissible because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The statute conveyed Congress's policy that the Attorney General should require pre-Act offenders to register as soon as feasible</li>
                <li>The Attorney General's authority was limited to addressing transitional issues</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Justice Gorsuch's dissent argued that the nondelegation doctrine should be reinvigorated, allowing delegation only when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Congress makes policy decisions and leaves executive to "fill up the details"</li>
                <li>Congress makes policy decisions and leaves executive to engage in fact-finding</li>
                <li>There is overlapping congressional and executive authority (e.g., foreign affairs)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Justice Alito's concurrence expressed willingness to reconsider the Court's approach to nondelegation if a majority were ready to do so.</p>

        <h4>Three Views of Nondelegation</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Strict View</strong>: The vesting of all legislative powers in Congress is a final allocation from which there can be no further delegation. (Justice Thomas's position)</li>
            <li><strong>Moderate View</strong>: Congress can delegate unless the scope of the grant is too broad, requiring line-drawing. (Current majority approach)</li>
            <li><strong>Permissive View</strong>: When Congress enacts a statute granting authority to the executive, it exercises its legislative power rather than delegating it. (Justice Stevens's position)</li>

    <h3>The Major Questions Doctrine</h3>

                <p>Hello! I'm Major Questions Mole. I help courts dig deep into statutory interpretation when agencies claim authority over questions of vast economic and political significance. I demand clear congressional authorization for major agency actions!</p>
            </div>
            <p>The Major Questions Doctrine (MQD) is a relatively recent development in administrative law, though its roots can be traced to earlier cases. It holds that courts should not defer to an agency's interpretation of a statute on questions of major economic or political significance unless Congress has clearly authorized the agency to address those questions.</p>

                <p>The Supreme Court invalidated the Clean Power Plan under the major questions doctrine, finding that the EPA's assertion of authority to restructure the nation's electricity production constituted a "transformative expansion" of its regulatory authority without clear congressional authorization.</p>

        <h4>When Does the Major Questions Doctrine Apply?</h4>
        <p>According to Justice Gorsuch's concurrence in <span class="case-name">West Virginia v. EPA</span>, the doctrine is likely to apply when:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>An agency claims power to resolve a matter of great political significance or end a profound national debate</li>
            <li>An agency seeks to regulate a significant portion of the economy or requires significant financial expenditure</li>
            <li>An agency seeks to intrude into an area traditionally reserved to the states</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To identify clear congressional authority, courts should consider:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The statutory provisions in their larger context (their place in the overall legislative scheme)</li>
            <li>The age and focus of the statute in relation to the problem the agency seeks to address</li>
            <li>The agency's past interpretations of the relevant statute</li>
            <li>Whether there's a mismatch between the agency's action and its congressionally assigned mission and expertise</li>
