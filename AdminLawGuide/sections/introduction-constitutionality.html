    <h3>The Administrative State and Its Constitutional Foundations</h3>
    
    <p>The modern administrative state consists of numerous agencies that perform vital governmental functions. These agencies operate at the intersection of the three traditional branches of government, combining aspects of legislative, executive, and judicial power. This structure raises fundamental questions about the proper allocation of governmental authority under the Constitution.</p>

        <h4>What Do Agencies Do?</h4>
        <p>Administrative agencies serve several critical functions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rulemaking</strong>: Creating regulations with the force of law to implement statutory directives</li>
            <li><strong>Adjudication</strong>: Resolving disputes and enforcing compliance with regulations</li>
            <li><strong>Licensing and Permitting</strong>: Granting permissions for regulated activities</li>
            <li><strong>Investigation and Enforcement</strong>: Monitoring compliance and penalizing violations</li>
            <li><strong>Information Gathering and Dissemination</strong>: Collecting data and issuing guidance</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>Rationales for Administrative Agencies</h4>
        <p>Several justifications support the delegation of authority to administrative agencies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Market Failures</strong>: Addressing externalities, information asymmetries, monopolies, and public goods</li>
            <li><strong>Expertise</strong>: Leveraging specialized knowledge for complex problems</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Responding quickly and adapting to changing conditions</li>
            <li><strong>Collective Values</strong>: Protecting resources and providing services based on shared societal values</li>
            <li><strong>Redistribution</strong>: Implementing policies to increase equality and protect vulnerable populations</li>
            <li><strong>Paternalism</strong>: Implementing policies for public safety and well-being (e.g., "nudges" for safer choices)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p>The case of <span class="case-name">Massachusetts v. EPA</span> (2007) illustrates these principles in action, where the Supreme Court considered the EPA's authority and obligation to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act.</p>

<div class="explanation" id="nondelegation">
    <h3>The Nondelegation Doctrine</h3>
    
    <p>The nondelegation doctrine stems from Article I of the Constitution, which states that "All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress." This raises a fundamental question: Can Congress delegate its legislative powers to the executive branch (including administrative agencies)?</p>

                <p>In a fragmented 5-3 decision (with Justice Kavanaugh not participating), the Court upheld the delegation. However, the dissent and separate opinions signaled potential willingness to revive a stronger nondelegation doctrine.</p>

            <div class="case-reasoning">
                <p>Justice Kagan's plurality opinion found that SORNA's delegation was permissible because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The statute conveyed Congress's policy that the Attorney General should require pre-Act offenders to register as soon as feasible</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Justice Gorsuch's dissent argued that the nondelegation doctrine should be reinvigorated, allowing delegation only when:</p>

            <p>The Major Questions Doctrine (MQD) is a relatively recent development in administrative law, though its roots can be traced to earlier cases.

        <h4>When Does the Major Questions Doctrine Apply?</h4>
        <p>According to Justice Gorsuch's concurrence in <span class="case-name">West Virginia v. EPA</span>, the doctrine is likely to apply when:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>An agency claims power to resolve a matter of great political significance or end a profound national debate</li>
            <li>An agency seeks to regulate a significant portion of the economy or requires significant financial expenditure</li>
            <li>An agency seeks to intrude into an area traditionally reserved to the states</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To identify clear congressional authority, courts should consider:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The statutory provisions in their larger context (their place in the overall legislative scheme)</li>
            <li>The age and focus of the statute in relation to the problem the agency seeks to address</li>
