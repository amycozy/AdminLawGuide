    <h3>The Administrative State and Its Constitutional Foundations</h3>
    
    <p>The modern administrative state consists of numerous agencies that perform vital governmental functions. These agencies operate at the intersection of the three traditional branches of government, combining aspects of legislative, executive, and judicial power. This structure raises fundamental questions about the proper allocation of governmental authority under the Constitution.</p>

        <h4>What Do Agencies Do?</h4>
        <p>Administrative agencies serve several critical functions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rulemaking</strong>: Creating regulations with the force of law to implement statutory directives</li>
            <li><strong>Adjudication</strong>: Resolving disputes and enforcing compliance with regulations</li>
            <li><strong>Licensing and Permitting</strong>: Granting permissions for regulated activities</li>
            <li><strong>Investigation and Enforcement</strong>: Monitoring compliance and penalizing violations</li>
            <li><strong>Information Gathering and Dissemination</strong>: Collecting data and issuing guidance</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>Rationales for Administrative Agencies</h4>
        <p>Several justifications support the delegation of authority to administrative agencies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Market Failures</strong>: Addressing externalities, information asymmetries, monopolies, and public goods</li>
            <li><strong>Expertise</strong>: Leveraging specialized knowledge for complex problems</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Responding quickly and adapting to changing conditions</li>
            <li><strong>Collective Values</strong>: Protecting resources and providing services based on shared societal values</li>
            <li><strong>Redistribution</strong>: Implementing policies to increase equality and protect vulnerable populations</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p>The case of <span class="case-name">Massachusetts v. EPA</span> (2007) illustrates these principles in action, where the Supreme Court considered the EPA's authority and obligation to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act.</p>

<div class="explanation" id="nondelegation">
    <h3>The Nondelegation Doctrine</h3>
    
    <p>The nondelegation doctrine stems from Article I of the Constitution, which states that "All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress." This raises a fundamental question: Can Congress delegate its legislative powers to the executive branch (including administrative agencies)?</p>

                    <li>The term "fair competition" was too vague and undefined</li>
                    <li>There were insufficient constraints on the President's discretion</li>
                    <li>This amounted to Congress abdication of its lawmaking function</li>

                <li>Congress makes policy decisions and leaves executive to engage in fact-finding</li>

            <p>The Major Questions Doctrine (MQD) is a relatively recent development in administrative law, though its roots can be traced to earlier cases.

        <div class="case-facts">
            <p>The SEC brought an administrative proceeding against Raymond Lucia for violating securities laws. The case was heard by an SEC administrative law judge (ALJ) who was not appointed by the SEC Commissioners but by SEC staff.

            <p>The Supreme Court held that SEC ALJs are "Officers of the United States" subject to the Appointments Clause because they exercise significant authority and have career appointments. Therefore, they must be appointed by the President, courts, or department heads.</p>

            <p>Coast Guard officers were convicted by courts-martial and their convictions were affirmed by the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals.

            <p>The Supreme Court held that the judges on the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals were "inferior officers" rather than "principal officers," and thus their appointment by the Secretary of Transportation (a department head) was constitutional.</p>

                <li>Coast Guard judges were inferior officers because their decisions were reviewable by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, and they could be removed by the Judge Advocate General</li>
                <li>The key inquiry is whether the officer has a superior other than the President who directs and supervises their work</li>
                <li>The fact that an officer performs important duties with significant discretion does not make them a principal officer if they are supervised by principal officers</li>
