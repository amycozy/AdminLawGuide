    <h3>Rulemaking Authority and Agency Choice</h3>
    
    <p>Administrative agencies derive their authority to make rules from their organic statutes—the laws that create the agencies and define their powers. An agency cannot create rules unless Congress has authorized it to do so, either explicitly or implicitly.</p>

        <h4 class="case-name">National Petroleum Refiners Association v. FTC (D.C. Cir. 1973)</h4>
        <p class="case-citation">482 F.2d 672</p>
        <div class="case-facts">
            <p>The FTC promulgated a rule declaring that failure to post octane ratings on gas pumps was an unfair practice. The National Petroleum Refiners Association challenged the FTC's authority to issue substantive rules rather than proceeding through case-by-case adjudication.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-rule">
            <p>The D.C. Circuit upheld the FTC's substantive rulemaking power, finding that it had implicit authority under its organic statute to promulgate substantive rules, not just procedural ones.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-reasoning">
            <p>The court reasoned that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Agencies have good reasons to prefer rulemaking over adjudication in many instances</li>
                <li>Rulemaking is more efficient, allowing the agency to address issues comprehensively rather than piecemeal</li>
                <li>Rulemaking provides greater notice to regulated parties</li>
                <li>Rulemaking allows for broader public participation</li>
                <li>The statutory language and legislative history did not preclude substantive rulemaking</li>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>The APA's Definition of a "Rule"</h4>
        <p>The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) defines a "rule" in 5 U.S.C. § 551(4) as:</p>
        <blockquote>"[T]he whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency..."</blockquote>
        <p>This broad definition encompasses various types of agency pronouncements, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legislative Rules</strong>: Binding regulations with the force of law</li>
            <li><strong>Interpretive Rules</strong>: Agency interpretations of statutes or regulations</li>
            <li><strong>Policy Statements</strong>: General statements of agency policy</li>
            <li><strong>Procedural Rules</strong>: Rules governing agency procedures</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="explanation" id="rulemaking-adjudication">
    <h3>Rulemaking vs. Adjudication</h3>
    
    <p>Agencies can establish policy through either rulemaking or adjudication. The choice between these procedures involves important tradeoffs and may significantly affect both the agency's ability to accomplish its goals and the rights of regulated parties.</p>

            <p>Denver assessed property owners for the cost of paving the street adjacent to their properties. The city did not provide property owners with notice or an opportunity for an individualized hearing before imposing assessments.</p>

        <div class="case-facts">
            <p>Colorado's State Board of Equalization ordered a 40% increase in the valuation of all taxable property in Denver. Property owners challenged this order, arguing they were entitled to individualized hearings.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court held that due process did not require individualized hearings for general rules affecting many people.

    <div class="doctrine-box">
        <h4>Londoner and Bi-Metallic: The Distinction Between Adjudicative and Legislative Facts</h4>
        <p>These cases establish a fundamental distinction in administrative law:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Adjudicative Facts</strong>: Facts about specific parties (who did what, where, when, how, why) that warrant procedural protections</li>
            <li><strong>Legislative Facts</strong>: General facts that help determine questions of law, policy, and discretion (not requiring individualized hearings)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When an agency action involves adjudicative facts concerning specific individuals, due process may require hearing rights even if the APA does not. When an action involves legislative facts affecting many people in the same way, due process typically does not require individualized hearings.</p>

    <p>Adjudication is the process by which an agency makes a determination concerning the rights of specific parties in a particular matter. The APA establishes procedures for both formal and informal adjudication, with formal adjudication procedures outlined in §§ 554, 556, and 557.</p>
