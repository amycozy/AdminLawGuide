    <h3>Rulemaking Authority and Agency Choice</h3>
    
    <p>Administrative agencies derive their authority to make rules from their organic statutes—the laws that create the agencies and define their powers. An agency cannot create rules unless Congress has authorized it to do so, either explicitly or implicitly.</p>

        <h4 class="case-name">National Petroleum Refiners Association v. FTC (D.C. Cir. 1973)</h4>
        <p class="case-citation">482 F.2d 672</p>
        <div class="case-facts">
            <p>The FTC promulgated a rule declaring that failure to post octane ratings on gas pumps was an unfair practice. The National Petroleum Refiners Association challenged the FTC's authority to issue substantive rules rather than proceeding through case-by-case adjudication.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-rule">
            <p>The D.C. Circuit upheld the FTC's substantive rulemaking power, finding that it had implicit authority under its organic statute to promulgate substantive rules, not just procedural ones.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-reasoning">
            <p>The court reasoned that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Agencies have good reasons to prefer rulemaking over adjudication in many instances</li>
                <li>Rulemaking is more efficient, allowing the agency to address issues comprehensively rather than piecemeal</li>
                <li>Rulemaking provides greater notice to regulated parties</li>
                <li>Rulemaking allows for broader public participation</li>
                <li>The statutory language and legislative history did not preclude substantive rulemaking</li>

    <div class="key-point">
        <h4>The APA's Definition of a "Rule"</h4>
        <p>The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) defines a "rule" in 5 U.S.C. § 551(4) as:</p>
        <blockquote>"[T]he whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency..."</blockquote>
        <p>This broad definition encompasses various types of agency pronouncements, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legislative Rules</strong>: Binding regulations with the force of law</li>
            <li><strong>Interpretive Rules</strong>: Agency interpretations of statutes or regulations</li>
            <li><strong>Policy Statements</strong>: General statements of agency policy</li>
            <li><strong>Procedural Rules</strong>: Rules governing agency procedures</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="explanation" id="rulemaking-adjudication">
    <h3>Rulemaking vs. Adjudication</h3>
    
    <p>Agencies can establish policy through either rulemaking or adjudication. The choice between these procedures involves important tradeoffs and may significantly affect both the agency's ability to accomplish its goals and the rights of regulated parties.</p>

            <p>Denver assessed property owners for the cost of paving the street adjacent to their properties. The city did not provide property owners with notice or an opportunity for an individualized hearing before imposing assessments.</p>

            <p>Colorado's State Board of Equalization ordered a 40% increase in the valuation of all taxable property in Denver. Property owners challenged this order, arguing they were entitled to individualized hearings.</p>

    <div class="doctrine-box">
        <h4>Londoner and Bi-Metallic: The Distinction Between Adjudicative and Legislative Facts</h4>
        <p>These cases establish a fundamental distinction in administrative law:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Adjudicative Facts</strong>: Facts about specific parties (who did what, where, when, how, why) that warrant procedural protections</li>
            <li><strong>Legislative Facts</strong>: General facts that help determine questions of law, policy, and discretion (not requiring individualized hearings)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When an agency action involves adjudicative facts concerning specific individuals, due process may require hearing rights even if the APA does not. When an action involves legislative facts affecting many people in the same way, due process typically does not require individualized hearings.</p>

            <p>The court concluded that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The phrase "opportunity for public hearing" does not necessarily mean "on the record" hearing</li>
                <li>Under Chevron, the EPA's interpretation deserved deference</li>
                <li>Under Brand X, the agency's reasonable interpretation could overrule prior judicial precedent that was not based on a finding that the statute was unambiguous</li>

        <h4>Key Features of Formal Adjudication</h4>
        <p><strong>Pre-Hearing:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Notice to parties of time, place, nature of hearing, legal authority, and matters of fact and law asserted</li>
            <li>Opportunity to submit facts, arguments, offers of settlement</li>
            <li>Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) typically presides</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Hearing:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Right to present evidence and conduct cross-examination</li>
            <li>ALJ has authority to administer oaths, issue subpoenas, rule on evidence, regulate course of hearing</li>
            <li>Burden of proof on proponent of order</li>
            <li>Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply; all relevant evidence admissible</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Post-Hearing:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>ALJ issues either an "initial decision" (final unless appealed) or a "recommended decision" (agency must issue final decision)</li>
            <li>Agency's review of ALJ decisions is effectively de novo</li>
            <li>Final decision must include a statement of findings, conclusions, and reasons</li>
            <li>Judicial review generally available under APA § 706</li>

        <h4 class="case-name">Union Electric Co. v. FERC (D.C. Cir. 1989)</h4>
        <p class="case-citation">890 F.2d 1193</p>
        <div class="case-facts">
            <p>In setting Union Electric's rate of return, FERC took official notice of a decline in interest rates that occurred after the ALJ's decision. Union Electric was not given an opportunity to challenge this factual determination before FERC issued its final decision.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-rule">
            <p>The D.C. Circuit set aside FERC's decision because the agency violated APA § 556(e), which requires that parties be given an opportunity to show the contrary when an agency takes official notice of a material fact.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-reasoning">
            <p>The court emphasized that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The right to rebut officially noticed facts is a fundamental procedural protection</li>
                <li>The agency must consider and address the party's rebuttal arguments</li>
                <li>This procedural protection is essential for ensuring the accuracy of agency decisions</li>
