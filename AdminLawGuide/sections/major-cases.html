                <p>The National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) authorized the President to approve "codes of fair competition" for various industries. These codes would have the force of law. The codes were to be developed by industry groups, subject to certain conditions, and then approved by the President. Schechter Poultry was prosecuted for violating the "Live Poultry Code."</p>
                </div>
                <div class="case-rule">
                <p>The Supreme Court unanimously struck down the NIRA, holding that it unconstitutionally delegated legislative power to the President. The Court found that the Act provided no standards or rules of conduct to limit discretion, only broad policy objectives.</p>

                <div class="case-reasoning">
                <p>Chief Justice Hughes's opinion emphasized:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Constitution does not permit Congress to abdicate its legislative functions by delegating unfettered discretion to the executive branch</li>
                    <li>While Congress may establish general standards and delegate rulemaking authority, it must provide an "intelligible principle" to guide the executive's discretion</li>
                    <li>The NIRA's authorization to create codes for "fair competition" was too vague and standardless</li>
                    <li>The delegation was particularly problematic because it allowed private industry groups to draft the codes</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Concurrences & Dissents</h5>

                <ul>
                    <li>Described the delegation as "delegation running riot" – a phrase that has become famous in administrative law</li>
                    <li>Distinguished between delegation of power to regulate an industry within defined limits (acceptable) and this case, where the delegation had "no boundaries"</li>
                    <li>Noted that the NIRA gave the President "virtually unfettered" discretion to make whatever codes he thought appropriate</li>
                    <li>Emphasized that delegation is permissible only when there are standards that meaningfully constrain the delegated power</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This concurrence is particularly influential because it colorfully articulated the core concern of the nondelegation doctrine and has been cited in subsequent cases to emphasize the need for meaningful constraints on delegated power.</p>

                <h5>Significance</h5>
                <p>Schechter Poultry represents one of only two cases in which the Supreme Court has struck down a statute on nondelegation grounds (the other being Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan). The case established the "intelligible principle" test for evaluating delegations, which remains the nominal test today, though the Court has since applied it very deferentially to uphold broad delegations.</p>

                    <li>Questioned whether the "intelligible principle" test adequately enforces the constitutional separation of powers</li>
                </ul>

                <p>West Virginia elevated the major questions doctrine from a background principle to a formal canon of statutory interpretation.

                <p><strong>Justice Scalia's dissent</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Criticized the majority for creating an "avulsive change" in judicial review of agency action</li>
                    <li>Argued that Chevron should apply to all authoritative agency interpretations of statutes they administer</li>
                    <li>Contended that the majority's approach would create confusion and unpredictability, as courts would have to determine what level of deference to apply in each case</li>
                    <li>Warned that the revival of Skidmore would lead to "totality of the circumstances" judicial decision-making with unpredictable results</li>
                    <li>Characterized the majority's approach as "th'ol' 'totality of the circumstances' test" that would lead to "uncertainty, unpredictability, and endless litigation"</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Justice Scalia's dissent has been particularly influential because it accurately predicted the confusion that would follow in determining when Chevron applies. His critique of Mead as creating an unpredictable standard has been cited by scholars and judges who advocate for either a broader application of Chevron or, more recently, for abandoning the Chevron framework entirely, as eventually occurred in Loper Bright.</p>

                <h5>Significance</h5>
                <p>Mead significantly limited the scope of Chevron deference by establishing that it applies only to agency interpretations that carry the force of law. The decision created a more nuanced approach to judicial review, with Chevron deference for formal interpretations and Skidmore deference for less formal ones. Mead also incentivized agencies to use more formal procedures to secure greater judicial deference. (Note: This framework was subsequently overruled by Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (2024).)</p>

                <h5>Significance</h5>
                <p>Massachusetts significantly expanded standing for states in environmental cases and limited agency discretion to decline regulation based on factors not specified in the relevant statute. The decision led directly to the EPA's subsequent regulation of greenhouse gases and established that agencies cannot evade statutory mandates by invoking policy considerations outside the statutory framework. The case also represents a more flexible approach to standing than Lujan, especially for states protecting quasi-sovereign interests.</p>

                <h5>Significance</h5>
                <p>Heckler established a significant limitation on judicial review of agency inaction, creating a presumption that decisions not to enforce are unreviewable. This presumption has been extended to other forms of agency inaction and discretionary decisions. The decision respects agency resource allocation decisions and prevents courts from micromanaging agency enforcement priorities, though it allows review in cases where agencies abandon statutory responsibilities or violate clear statutory directives.</p>
