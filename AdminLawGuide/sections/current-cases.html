                    <h5>Schedule F Executive Order Litigation</h5>
                    <p>In October 2020, President Trump issued Executive Order 13957 creating a new "Schedule F" employment category that would have reclassified thousands of career civil servants into positions with fewer job protections. While the Biden administration revoked this order, there are ongoing concerns about its potential reinstatement in a future administration.</p>

                    <p>The Trump administration's relocation of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) headquarters from Washington DC to Grand Junction, Colorado led to significant staff departures and organizational disruption.
