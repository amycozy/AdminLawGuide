Hand-drawn line art illustration of a cheerful humanoid character named "Standing Sam" representing legal standing in administrative law. Sam stands tall and confident, holding a measuring tape in one hand and a clipboard in the other. The character wears three clear badges on its chest labeled "INJURY," "CAUSATION," and "REDRESSABILITY." Sam is positioned next to a doorway labeled "COURT ACCESS" with a small funnel/filter above the door labeled "ZONE OF INTERESTS." The character has a simple, friendly face and wears casual clothes with a "PLAINTIFF" name tag. Style: clean black pen line drawing with minimal watercolor-style coloring in greens and blues, white background, children's book illustration style. The image should convey accessibility, evaluation, and the idea of meeting requirements.
