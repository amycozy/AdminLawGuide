Hand-drawn line art illustration of an inquisitive mole character representing the Major Questions Doctrine in administrative law. The mole wears round professorial glasses and holds a large magnifying glass, examining a document with a question mark. The mole stands near a dotted-line boundary circle labeled "AGENCY AUTHORITY." The character has a scholarly appearance with a small academic cap. Behind the mole is a simple line graph trending upward with a dollar symbol, representing economic significance. The mole has a thoughtful expression with small whiskers and wears a detective-style vest with pockets. Style: clean black pen line drawing with minimal watercolor-style coloring in warm amber and earth tones, white background, children's book illustration style. The image should convey curiosity, intelligence, and careful examination of boundaries.
