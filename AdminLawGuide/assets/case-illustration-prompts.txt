## Nondelegation Doctrine & Major Questions Cases

### A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States (1935)
Hand-drawn line art illustration showing Major Questions Mole examining a chaotic poultry market scene. The mole wears a concerned expression while looking at a large document labeled "NIRA: CODES OF FAIR COMPETITION" with an oversized presidential seal stamped on it. Scattered chicken coops are labeled with different industry rules. A scale in the background shows "Legislative Power" heavily outweighing "Executive Power." Style: clean black pen line drawing with minimal watercolor-style coloring in constitutional ambers and oranges, white background. The image should convey the concept of excessive delegation of legislative power without clear standards.

### Whitman v. American Trucking Associations (2001)
Hand-drawn line art illustration showing Major Questions Mole wearing a small EPA hat while measuring air with scientific instruments. The mole stands between a factory and a hospital, with a clipboard noting "PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH" with a question mark. A banner stretches across reading "REQUISITE...WITH ADEQUATE MARGIN" with the terms underlined. Style: clean black pen line drawing with minimal watercolor-style coloring in constitutional ambers and regulatory blues, white background. The image should convey the tension between agency discretion and intelligible principles from Congress.

### West Virginia v. EPA (2022)
Hand-drawn line art illustration showing Major Questions Mole standing at a crossroads between coal plants and wind turbines. The mole holds up a magnifying glass examining fine print in Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act while wearing a small judicial cap. Behind the mole is a large power grid transformation diagram with a giant question mark. A small West Virginia state flag is planted nearby. Style: clean black pen line drawing with minimal watercolor-style coloring in constitutional ambers with touches of judicial purple, white background. The image should convey the concept of agencies making decisions of vast economic and political significance without clear congressional authorization.

## Political Control of Agencies Cases

### INS v. Chadha (1983)
Hand-drawn line art illustration showing a person (representing Chadha) standing on a document bridge labeled "SUSPENSION OF DEPORTATION" that's being scissored in half by a floating hand labeled "ONE-HOUSE VETO."

Style: clean black pen line drawing with minimal watercolor-style coloring in procedural light blues and constitutional ambers, white background. The image should convey separation of powers and the requirements for legislative action.

### Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (2020)
Hand-drawn line art illustration showing a CFPB building structure with a single director at the top connected to the President by a chain labeled "FOR CAUSE REMOVAL" that's being cut with scissors. APA Architect examines the structure with a level tool labeled "SEPARATION OF POWERS." A document labeled "DODD-FRANK" is visible in the background. Style: clean black pen line drawing with minimal watercolor-style coloring in executive blues and procedural light blues, white background. The image should convey the constitutional issues with insulating a single agency head from presidential control.

A tiny day planner (Mead's product) sits on a customs desk. Style: clean black pen line drawing with minimal watercolor-style coloring in judicial purples and blues, white background. The image should convey the distinction between formal procedures deserving deference and less formal agency actions.

## Judicial Review Cases

A factory with a bubble enclosing multiple emission points is visible in the background. Style: clean black pen line drawing with minimal watercolor-style coloring in judicial purples and blues, white background. The image should convey the concept of deference to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes.

### Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (2024)

Style: clean black pen line drawing with minimal watercolor-style coloring in judicial purples with fading blues, white background. The image should convey the shift away from agency deference toward judicial interpretation.

### Kisor v. Wilkie (2019)
Hand-drawn line art illustration showing Chevron Chameleon carefully examining agency regulations with a magnifying glass labeled "GENUINE AMBIGUITY?" The chameleon stands at a crossroads with signposts pointing to "AUER DEFERENCE" and "INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT." A veteran's file with "PTSD" and "RELEVANT?" stamps is visible in the background. Style: clean black pen line drawing with minimal watercolor-style coloring in judicial purples and blues, white background. The image should convey the narrowed approach to deferring to agency interpretations of their own regulations.

## Access to Judicial Review Cases

### Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner (1967)
Hand-drawn line art illustration showing Standing Sam holding open a courthouse door with "PRE-ENFORCEMENT REVIEW" written above it. Sam uses a ripeness gauge with two dials: "FITNESS FOR REVIEW" and "HARDSHIP FROM DELAY." Pharmaceutical bottles with brand names and generic labels visible are lined up outside the door. Style: clean black pen line drawing with minimal watercolor-style coloring in greens and blues, white background. The image should convey accessibility to pre-enforcement judicial review when regulations have direct effects.

### Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife (1992)

Sam looks skeptical at the measurement while checking a clipboard with "CONCRETE," "PARTICULARIZED," and "IMMINENT" checkboxes, all unchecked. A faded map shows international project locations with question marks. Style: clean black pen line drawing with minimal watercolor-style coloring in greens and blues, white background. The image should convey the requirement for concrete, imminent injury rather than speculative future harm.

### Massachusetts v. EPA (2007)
Hand-drawn line art illustration showing Standing Sam wearing a special "STATE" hat and measuring rising water levels against a coastal property marker. Sam holds a document labeled "SPECIAL SOLICITUDE" with a gold star. In the background, car emissions form question marks in the air, with a tiny EPA building visible with blinds drawn. Style: clean black pen line drawing with minimal watercolor-style coloring in greens, blues and touches of executive blue, white background. The image should convey states' special standing position and concrete injury from climate impacts.

### Heckler v. Chaney (1985)
Hand-drawn line art illustration showing Standing Sam being blocked from entering a courtroom door by FDA officials who are pointing to a sign reading "ENFORCEMENT DISCRETION: PRESUMPTIVELY UNREVIEWABLE." Sam looks frustrated while holding a scale of justice. In the background, prison elements and medicine vials are faintly visible. Style: clean black pen line drawing with minimal watercolor-style coloring in greens, blues, and touches of executive blue, white background. The image should convey the concept of agency discretion in enforcement decisions being shielded from judicial review.

## Best Practices for Consistent Implementation

1. **Character Expression**: Each mascot should maintain their core characteristics while reacting appropriately to the case scenario:
   - Chevron Chameleon: Curious, adaptive, thoughtful expression
   - Major Questions Mole: Inquisitive, analytical, boundary-conscious
   - Standing Sam: Measuring, evaluating, access-focused
   - APA Architect: Methodical, process-oriented, structured

2. **Case Elements**: Include specific factual elements that make each case recognizable and distinct:
   - Key parties represented visually
   - Central dispute or question clearly illustrated
   - Relevant legal documents or principles labeled

3. **Visual Memory Aids**: Use visual metaphors and symbolic elements to enhance memory:
   - Scales for balancing tests
   - Bridges/doors for access issues
   - Measuring tools for standards
   - Question marks for ambiguities

4. **Doctrinal Integration**: Ensure each illustration connects with the broader doctrinal framework:
   - Color palette reflects doctrinal area
   - Visual elements reinforce conceptual relationships
   - Mascot actions embody core principles of the relevant doctrine

These prompts are designed to create a cohesive visual language around key administrative law cases while maintaining consistency with the existing Admin Law Guide visual style.
