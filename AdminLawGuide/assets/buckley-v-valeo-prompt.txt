Hand-drawn line art illustration showing APAlligator examining the structure of a Federal Election Commission building with a constitutional measuring tape labeled "APPOINTMENTS CLAUSE." The alligator points to an organizational chart showing commissioners appointed by different branches of government, with question marks next to congressional appointees. Floating dollar bills and campaign contribution forms flow toward a scale of justice that balances "FREE SPEECH" with "PREVENTING CORRUPTION." In the background, a partial document labeled "FECA" (Federal Election Campaign Act) is visible with sections highlighted as "CONSTITUTIONAL" and others crossed out as "UNCONSTITUTIONAL." Style: clean black pen line drawing with minimal watercolor-style coloring in constitutional ambers/oranges (#f57c00, #fff3e0) with touches of procedural light blues, white background. The image should convey the tension between campaign finance regulation and constitutional limitations on agency structure and authority, highlighting the separation of powers concerns with Congress appointing officers who exercise executive functions.
