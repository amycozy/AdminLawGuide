Hand-drawn line art illustration of a methodical APAlligator character representing the Administrative Procedure Act. The APAlligator wears a hard hat with "APA" printed on it and holds blueprint plans labeled "AGENCY PROCEDURES." The character has a tool belt containing miniature tools labeled "NOTICE," "COMMENT," and "STATEMENT OF BASIS." The APAlligator stands beside a partially constructed building framework representing agency rulemaking. A small clock and calendar are visible, representing timeframes and deadlines. The character has a detail-oriented expression and wears professional attire with rolled-up sleeves. Style: clean black pen line drawing with minimal watercolor-style coloring in blues and light browns, white background, children's book illustration style. The image should convey organization, process, and structured development.
