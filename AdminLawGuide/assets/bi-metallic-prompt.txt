Hand-drawn line art illustration showing APAlligator standing between two clearly labeled paths: "LEGISLATIVE FACTS" (a wide road with many people) and "ADJUDICATIVE FACTS" (a narrow path with just a few individuals). The alligator holds up a large sign reading "DUE PROCESS REQUIREMENTS" with a dividing line showing "INDIVIDUAL HEARINGS" on the adjudicative side only. In the background, a cityscape of Denver with property buildings shows a banner reading "40% VALUATION INCREASE" affecting all structures equally. A small character representing Bi-Metallic Investment Co. stands at a courthouse door that has a "NO INDIVIDUAL HEARINGS REQUIRED" sign posted. Justice Holmes appears as a small figure with a speech bubble stating "WHERE MANY ARE AFFECTED, POLITICAL PROCESS IS THE REMEDY." A scale in the corner weighs "EFFICIENCY OF GOVERNANCE" against "INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPATION." Style: clean black pen line drawing with minimal watercolor-style coloring using procedural light blues (#03a9f4, #e1f5fe) blended with judicial purples for the constitutional elements, white background. The image should convey the fundamental distinction between rules affecting many people equally (which don't require individual hearings) versus those affecting specific individuals (which may require procedural protections).
