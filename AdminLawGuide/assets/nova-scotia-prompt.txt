Hand-drawn line art illustration showing APAlligator scrutinizing a laboratory report labeled "SCIENTIFIC DATA" with a magnifying glass while standing next to filing cabinets clearly marked "FDA SMOKED FISH REGULATIONS." The alligator is holding up a document labeled "APA ยง 553" with an emphasized section about "meaningful public participation." A worried fish processor (representing Nova Scotia Food Products) stands in the background near processing equipment, pointing to a notepad with "OUR COMMENTS" prominently displayed but crossed out with a red "IGNORED" stamp. Floating speech bubbles contain key phrases: "DISCLOSE SCIENTIFIC BASIS" and "RESPOND TO SIGNIFICANT COMMENTS." A scale in the corner balances "AGENCY EFFICIENCY" against "PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS." Style: clean black pen line drawing with minimal watercolor-style coloring in procedural light blues (#03a9f4, #e1f5fe), white background. The image should convey the importance of agency transparency and responsiveness in the rulemaking process, highlighting that even informal rulemaking requires meaningful public participation and agency consideration of relevant comments.
