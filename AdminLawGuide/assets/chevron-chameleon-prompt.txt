Hand-drawn line art illustration of a friendly chameleon character representing the Chevron doctrine in administrative law. The chameleon has large, intelligent eyes and is perched on a traditional scales of justice balance with "STATUTE" labeled on one side and "AGENCY" on the other. The chameleon wears tiny black-rimmed spectacles and a miniature judge's collar. Its tail curls into a question mark shape. The chameleon's body transitions from blue to purple, symbolizing adaptability to different interpretations. The background is simple with light legal-themed elements like a faint outline of a law book. Style: clean black pen line drawing with minimal watercolor-style coloring in pastel blues and purples, white background, children's book illustration style. The image should convey both scholarly wisdom and approachable charm.
