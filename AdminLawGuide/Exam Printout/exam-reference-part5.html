    <h1>Administrative Law Exam Reference - APA Deep Dive & Flowcharts</h1>
    
    <div class="exam-tip">
        <p><strong>How to Use This Section:</strong> This part contains a detailed analysis of key Administrative Procedure Act provisions and flowcharts for analyzing administrative law problems. Use these frameworks to work methodically through complex questions on your exam.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>I. APA Key Sections</h2>
    
    <h3>A. APA § 551: Key Definitions</h3>
    <div class="code-box">
§ 551(4) "rule" - agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy...

§ 551(5) "rule making" - agency process for formulating, amending, or repealing a rule

§ 551(6) "order" - the whole or a part of a final disposition... of an agency in a matter other than rule making

§ 551(7) "adjudication" - agency process for the formulation of an order

§ 551(13) "agency action" - includes the whole or a part of an agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or failure to act
    </div>
    
    <p><strong>Practical Implications of Definitions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Whether an agency action is "rulemaking" or "adjudication" determines which procedures apply</li>
        <li>"Agency action" definition limits what can be challenged under APA</li>
        <li>Broad definition of "rule" includes legislative rules, interpretive rules, policy statements, and procedural rules</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>B. APA § 553: Rulemaking</h3>
    <div class="code-box">
§ 553(b) General notice of proposed rule making shall be published in the Federal Register...
    (1) a statement of the time, place, and nature of public rule making proceedings;
    (2) reference to the legal authority under which the rule is proposed; and
    (3) either the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved.

§ 553(c) ...the agency shall give interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule making through submission of written data, views, or arguments... the agency shall incorporate in the rules adopted a concise general statement of their basis and purpose.

§ 553(d) The required publication or service of a substantive rule shall be made not less than 30 days before its effective date...
    </div>
    
    <h4>Exceptions to § 553 Notice-and-Comment Requirements:</h4>
    <div class="code-box">
§ 553(a) This section applies... except to the extent that there is involved—
    (1) a military or foreign affairs function of the United States; or
    (2) a matter relating to agency management or personnel or to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts.

§ 553(b) Except when notice or hearing is required by statute, this subsection does not apply—
    (A) to interpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice; or
    (B) when the agency for good cause finds... that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.
    </div>
    
    <div class="flowchart-box">
        <h4>Flowchart: Is Notice-and-Comment Required?</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Is it a "rule" under § 551(4)? If no, § 553 doesn't apply.</li>
            <li>Is it expressly excluded under § 553(a) (military/foreign affairs or agency management/property/grants/contracts)? If yes, exempt.</li>
            <li>Is it an interpretive rule, general policy statement, or procedural rule under § 553(b)(A)? If yes, exempt.</li>
            <li>Does the agency have "good cause" under § 553(b)(B) to find notice and comment impracticable/unnecessary/contrary to public interest? If yes, exempt.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, notice-and-comment is required.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <h3>C. APA §§ 554, 556, 557: Formal Proceedings</h3>
    <div class="code-box">
§ 554(a) This section applies... in every case of adjudication required by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing...

§ 556(d) A party is entitled to present his case or defense by oral or documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts...

§ 557(c) ...The record shall show the ruling on each finding, conclusion, or exception presented. All decisions... shall include a statement of—
    (A) findings and conclusions, and the reasons or basis therefor, on all the material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record; and
    (B) the appropriate rule, order, sanction, relief, or denial thereof.
    </div>
    
    <p><strong>Trigger for Formal Procedures:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Formal rulemaking: Statute requires rules "on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing" (rarely required)</li>
        <li>Formal adjudication: Statute requires determination "on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing" (more common)</li>
        <li>Language must explicitly require "on the record" hearing (<span class="case-name">Florida East Coast Railway</span>)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>D. APA §§ 701-706: Judicial Review</h3>
    <div class="code-box">
§ 701(a) This chapter applies... except to the extent that—
    (1) statutes preclude judicial review; or
    (2) agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.

§ 702 A person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof...

§ 704 Agency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court are subject to judicial review...

§ 706 ...The reviewing court shall—
    (1) compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed; and
    (2) hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be—
        (A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;
        (B) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity;
        (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right;
        (D) without observance of procedure required by law;
        (E) unsupported by substantial evidence in a case subject to sections 556 and 557... or otherwise reviewed on the record of an agency hearing provided by statute; or
        (F) unwarranted by the facts to the extent that the facts are subject to trial de novo by the reviewing court.
    </div>
    
    <div class="flowchart-box">
        <h4>Flowchart: Is Judicial Review Available?</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Is the challenge within statute of limitations? (6 years unless specified elsewhere)</li>
            <li>Does a specific statute provide or preclude review? If precludes, stop - no review.</li>
            <li>Is the action "committed to agency discretion by law" under § 701(a)(2)? If yes, presumptively unreviewable.</li>
            <li>Is it "agency action" under § 551(13)? If no, not reviewable.</li>
            <li>Is it "final agency action" under § 704 (see Bennett test)? If no, not reviewable.</li>
            <li>Does plaintiff have standing? (Lujan test of injury, causation, redressability)</li>
            <li>Has plaintiff exhausted administrative remedies? If not, may be premature.</li>
            <li>Is the issue ripe? (Abbott Labs test of fitness and hardship)</li>
            <li>If all above satisfied, judicial review is available.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <h2>II. Flowcharts for Agency Action Analysis</h2>
    
    <h3>A. Distinguishing Rule Types</h3>
    
    <div class="flowchart-box">
        <h4>Flowchart: Is this a Legislative Rule (requiring notice and comment)?</h4>
        
        <p><strong>Legal Effect Test:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Does the rule create new rights, duties, or obligations? If yes, likely legislative.</li>
            <li>Does the rule have binding legal effect on regulated parties? If yes, likely legislative.</li>
            <li>Does the rule bind the agency itself, removing discretion in future cases? If yes, likely legislative.</li>
            <li>Does the agency cite specific statutory authority for the rule? If yes, suggests legislative.</li>
            <li>Does the agency intend the rule to have the force of law? If yes, likely legislative.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><strong>Counter-Indicators (suggests interpretive rule, policy statement, or procedural rule):</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Does the rule merely explain existing statutory or regulatory requirements? If yes, likely interpretive.</li>
            <li>Does the rule leave agency free to exercise discretion in individual cases? If yes, likely policy statement.</li>
            <li>Does the rule address agency internal operations or interactions with public? If yes, likely procedural.</li>
            <li>Does the rule create only tentative guidance, not binding norms? If yes, likely policy statement.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <h3>B. Arbitrary & Capricious Review Analysis</h3>
    
    <div class="flowchart-box">
        <h4>Flowchart: Arbitrary & Capricious Analysis (State Farm)</h4>
        
        <p><strong>Step 1: Identify Agency Action Type</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>New rule/policy implementation</li>
            <li>Change in existing policy (<span class="case-name">Fox Television</span> considerations)</li>
            <li>Rescission of prior policy (<span class="case-name">State Farm</span> & <span class="case-name">DHS v. Regents</span>)</li>
            <li>Refusal to initiate rulemaking/enforcement (<span class="case-name">Heckler</span> presumption)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Step 2: Apply State Farm Factors</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Did the agency examine relevant data?</li>
            <li>Did the agency articulate a rational connection between facts and choice?</li>
            <li>Did the agency consider all important aspects of the problem?</li>
            <li>Is the agency's explanation consistent with evidence?</li>
            <li>Did the agency rely on factors Congress did not intend it to consider?</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><strong>Step 3: For Policy Changes, Add Fox/Regents Analysis</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Did the agency acknowledge it is changing position?</li>
            <li>Did the agency provide good reasons for the change?</li>
            <li>If change rests on factual findings contradicting prior policy, did agency provide reasoned explanation?</li>
            <li>Did the agency consider serious reliance interests created by prior policy?</li>
            <li>Did the agency consider alternatives to complete rescission?</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <h3>C. Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies</h3>
    
    <div class="flowchart-box">
        <h4>Flowchart: Is Exhaustion Required?</h4>
        
        <p><strong>Step 1: Identify Type of Exhaustion</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Does statute explicitly require exhaustion? If yes, mandatory exhaustion applies.</li>
            <li>Is exhaustion required by agency regulation that was subjected to notice and comment? If yes, treated similar to statutory exhaustion.</li>
            <li>If neither, discretionary/prudential exhaustion doctrine applies (more exceptions).</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><strong>Step 2: Check for Exceptions (mainly for prudential exhaustion)</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Futility:</strong> Would pursuit of administrative remedies be clearly useless?</li>
            <li><strong>Irreparable Harm:</strong> Would requiring exhaustion cause irreparable injury?</li>
            <li><strong>Inadequate Remedy:</strong> Is administrative remedy inadequate or unavailable?</li>
            <li><strong>Bias/Prejudgment:</strong> Has agency demonstrated bias or prejudgment?</li>
            <li><strong>Constitutional Question:</strong> Is claim a constitutional challenge outside agency expertise?</li>
            <li><strong>Purely Legal Question:</strong> Is issue purely legal, not requiring agency fact-finding?</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><strong>Step 3: Determine Effect of Non-Exhaustion</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Statutory exhaustion: Jurisdictional bar if not exhausted (absent statutory exception)</li>
            <li>Prudential exhaustion: Court may excuse for policy reasons</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>III. APA § 553 Exemption Analysis</h2>
    
    <h3>A. Interpretive Rules</h3>
    
    <div class="test-steps">
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Rules that clarify or explain existing law rather than creating new legal obligations</p>
        
        <p><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Derived from and explains existing statutes or regulations</li>
            <li>No independent legal effect</li>
            <li>Persuasive but not binding on courts</li>
            <li>Agency can change without notice and comment (<span class="case-name">Perez</span>)</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><strong>Test to Identify:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Does it create new rights/duties or merely explain existing ones?</li>
            <li>Does it derive from and stay within bounds of statute or regulation?</li>
            <li>Could the rule be upheld only as interpretation of existing law?</li>
            <li>Does the agency have power to enforce independent of rule?</li>
            <li>What did agency say about rule's nature and intended effect?</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><strong>Judicial Deference:</strong> Receives Skidmore respect based on persuasiveness, not Chevron deference</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>B. General Statements of Policy</h3>
    
    <div class="test-steps">
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Statements indicating how agency intends to exercise discretionary power in future cases</p>
        
        <p><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Announces tentative intentions for future</li>
            <li>No binding effect on regulated parties</li>
            <li>Agency retains discretion to deviate in individual cases</li>
            <li>Prospective in nature</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><strong>Test to Identify:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Is there genuine agency discretion to deviate from policy in individual cases?</li>
            <li>Is declaratory language absent (e.g., "shall," "must," "will")?</li>
            <li>Is the statement framed as tentative, not final?</li>
            <li>Does it use language of likelihood rather than certainty?</li>
            <li>Do agency personnel maintain flexibility in application?</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Enforcement priorities, non-binding guidance documents, agency manuals</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>C. Procedural Rules</h3>
    
    <div class="test-steps">
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Rules governing agency organization, procedure, or practice</p>
        
        <p><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Addresses internal agency operations or interactions with public</li>
            <li>Doesn't alter substantive standards by which agency evaluates applications</li>
            <li>Doesn't significantly affect substantive rights or interests</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><strong>Test to Identify:</strong></p>
        <ol>
