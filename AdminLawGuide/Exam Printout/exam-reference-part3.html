        <h1>ADMINISTRATIVE LAW EXAM REFERENCE - MAJOR CASES PART 2</h1>
    </div>

    <h1>Administrative Law Exam Reference - Major Cases (Procedures & Judicial Review)</h1>
    
    <div class="exam-tip">
        <p><strong>How to Use This Section:</strong> This part covers key cases on agency procedures and judicial review access. Each case includes facts, holding, reasoning, and significance. These cases illustrate how courts review agency actions and when judicial review is available.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>I. Agency Procedures Cases</h2>
    
    <h3>A. Rulemaking Procedures</h3>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC</span> <span class="case-citation">(435 U.S. 519, 1978)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> The Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) conducted rulemaking on the environmental effects of the nuclear fuel cycle using notice-and-comment procedures. The D.C. Circuit held these procedures inadequate and required additional procedures like cross-examination.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> Courts cannot impose procedural requirements beyond those in the APA or other statutes. Agencies have discretion to fashion their own procedures as long as statutory minimums are met.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Justice Rehnquist emphasized that the APA establishes "the maximum procedural requirements" courts may impose. Agencies need flexibility to adapt procedures to regulatory needs. The D.C. Circuit's approach would create unpredictability and interfere with agency expertise.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Fundamental principle of administrative law that courts cannot add procedural requirements beyond APA. Preserves agency flexibility in choosing procedures. Establishes that APA requirements are both floor and ceiling.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">United States v. Nova Scotia Food Products Corp.</span> <span class="case-citation">(568 F.2d 240, 2d Cir. 1977)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> FDA issued regulations for processing smoked fish to prevent botulism. Nova Scotia argued the regulations would destroy commercial viability of their whitefish products. FDA failed to disclose scientific research underlying proposed rule and didn't respond to proposed alternatives.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> FDA violated APA by failing to disclose scientific research underlying the rule and failing to respond to significant comments regarding alternatives.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Meaningful public participation requires disclosure of scientific data. Courts will enforce basic requirements of fair notice and opportunity to comment. Agencies must respond to significant comments, particularly when they suggest less burdensome alternatives.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Enhanced notice-and-comment requirements. Established that agencies must disclose technical studies and data. Required agencies to respond to significant comments. Example of procedural inadequacy despite facial compliance with APA.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Association</span> <span class="case-citation">(575 U.S. 92, 2015)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> Department of Labor issued interpretive rule in 2010 stating mortgage loan officers were entitled to overtime pay, contradicting its 2006 interpretation. DOL did not use notice-and-comment procedures. Mortgage Bankers Association challenged this procedural choice.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> Agencies need not use notice-and-comment procedures when changing interpretive rules, even if the new interpretation departs significantly from a previous one.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Justice Sotomayor emphasized that APA explicitly exempts interpretive rules from notice-and-comment requirements, with no exception for changes. D.C. Circuit's Paralyzed Veterans doctrine improperly created additional procedural requirements beyond APA, violating Vermont Yankee.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Reaffirmed Vermont Yankee's prohibition on courts imposing extra-APA procedures. Clarified that interpretive rules remain exempt from notice-and-comment even when changing prior interpretations. Alito, Scalia, and Thomas concurrences suggested reconsideration of deference doctrines.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>B. Rulemaking vs. Adjudication</h3>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co.</span> <span class="case-citation">(416 U.S. 267, 1974)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> NLRB reversed its position that buyers were "managerial employees" excluded from NLRA protection through adjudication rather than rulemaking. Bell Aerospace argued this policy change required rulemaking.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> Agencies have broad discretion to establish policy through either rulemaking or adjudication, even when changing prior policy.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Justice Powell noted that NLRB traditionally developed policy through adjudication and SEC v. Chenery Corp. (1947) established agencies' discretion to choose between rulemaking and adjudication. "The choice between rulemaking and adjudication lies primarily in the informed discretion of the administrative agency."</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Established agencies' broad discretion to choose policymaking tools. Allowed agencies to announce new policies through individual cases. Created adjudication exception to general preference for notice-and-comment. Recognized agencies may proceed case-by-case rather than with comprehensive rules.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">NLRB v. Wyman-Gordon Co.</span> <span class="case-citation">(394 U.S. 759, 1969)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> NLRB announced general rule requiring employers to provide union with employee names and addresses in Excelsior Underwear adjudication, but applied it prospectively only. Later applied this rule to Wyman-Gordon in separate adjudication.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> NLRB could not use adjudication to announce purely prospective rules without following APA rulemaking procedures, but could still require Wyman-Gordon to provide employee information in this adjudication.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Plurality opinion by Justice Fortas criticized NLRB for using adjudication to announce purely prospective rule, calling it an "agency . . . blowing hot and cold." However, agency could require information disclosure in this adjudication. Several justices wrote separate opinions, creating confusion about holding.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Places some limits on Bell Aerospace discretion. Suggests agencies shouldn't use adjudication solely as vehicle for announcing general, prospective rules. However, practical impact limited by fragmented opinions and subsequent developments.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>C. Arbitrary & Capricious Review</h3>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Ass'n v. State Farm</span> <span class="case-citation">(463 U.S. 29, 1983)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) rescinded requirement for passive restraints (automatic seatbelts or airbags) in new cars. NHTSA cited doubts about safety benefits because manufacturers would likely install detachable automatic seatbelts that might not be used.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> NHTSA's rescission was arbitrary and capricious because the agency failed to consider obvious alternatives (e.g., mandating airbags) and didn't offer a reasoned explanation for its action.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Justice White established that rescission of a rule must meet same "arbitrary and capricious" standard as promulgation. NHTSA failed to consider airbags as alternative and didn't explain why it didn't keep automatic belt requirement for nondetachable belts. Agency's reasoning was inadequate given safety statute's purpose.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Established framework for "hard look" review. Created test for evaluating adequacy of agency reasoning. Required agencies to examine relevant data, articulate satisfactory explanation, consider important aspects of problem, and offer explanation consistent with evidence.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">FCC v. Fox Television Stations</span> <span class="case-citation">(556 U.S. 502, 2009)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> FCC changed its policy on "fleeting expletives," finding isolated uses of profanity actionable under indecency rules. Previously, FCC generally did not penalize isolated, non-literal expletives. Fox challenged policy change as arbitrary and capricious.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> When changing policy, an agency must acknowledge the change and provide good reasons, but need not demonstrate that the new policy is better than the old one.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Justice Scalia rejected heightened scrutiny for policy changes. Agency must display awareness it is changing position, provide reasoned explanation, and address reliance interests and factual contradictions. But no special justification beyond what would suffice for new policy from scratch is needed.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Clarified State Farm for policy changes. Rejected view that policy changes face more stringent review. However, Kennedy concurrence and Breyer dissent emphasized need to explain reasons for abandoning old policy, creating some ambiguity.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">Department of Homeland Security v. Regents</span> <span class="case-citation">(140 S.Ct. 1891, 2020)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> Trump administration rescinded DACA program, which deferred deportation for certain undocumented immigrants brought to U.S. as children. Initial rescission memo cited only legal conclusion that DACA was unlawful. Later, Secretary provided policy reasons.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> Rescission was arbitrary and capricious because DHS failed to consider important aspects of the problem, including whether to retain forbearance policy while eliminating benefits and the reliance interests of DACA recipients.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Chief Justice Roberts held that post hoc rationalizations couldn't be considered. Initial memo relied solely on illegality, not policy discretion. Agency failed to consider more limited options than full rescission. Most importantly, agency failed to assess and address significant reliance interests of DACA recipients who had built lives based on program.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Further developed Fox's recognition that policy changes affecting reliance interests require additional consideration. Reinforced State Farm requirement to consider important aspects of problem. Clarified that agencies must address reliance interests and alternatives to full rescission.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>II. Judicial Review Access Cases</h2>
    
    <h3>A. Availability of Review</h3>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">Heckler v. Chaney</span> <span class="case-citation">(470 U.S. 821, 1985)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> Death row inmates petitioned FDA to take enforcement action against use of drugs for lethal injection, arguing drugs were unapproved for this purpose. FDA refused to investigate, claiming enforcement discretion. Inmates sought judicial review of FDA's refusal.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> Agency decisions not to take enforcement action are presumptively unreviewable as "committed to agency discretion by law" under APA § 701(a)(2).</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Justice Rehnquist analogized non-enforcement to prosecutorial discretion. Agencies balance many factors including resource allocation, likelihood of success, and priorities. Courts lack manageable standards to evaluate such decisions. Unlike affirmative acts, inaction generally doesn't involve exercise of coercive power.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Created presumption against review of non-enforcement decisions. Established major exception to presumption of reviewability. Established that some decisions are "committed to agency discretion" when no law to apply. Presumption rebuttable when statute provides guidelines or agency adopts self-limiting rules.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe</span> <span class="case-citation">(401 U.S. 402, 1971)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> Secretary of Transportation approved highway through public park. Statute prohibited such approval unless "no feasible and prudent alternative." Secretary provided no formal findings explaining decision.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> Secretary's decision was reviewable under APA, and court must conduct "thorough, probing, in-depth review" to determine if Secretary acted within statutory authority and followed procedural requirements.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Justice Marshall rejected argument that decision was unreviewable. "Committed to agency discretion" exception is "very narrow," applicable only when "no law to apply." Here, "feasible and prudent alternative" standard provided law to apply. Court must ensure Secretary considered relevant factors and made no clear error of judgment.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Established narrow reading of § 701(a)(2) exception. Created foundation for "hard look" review. Established court's role in ensuring reasoned decision-making. Required agencies to provide contemporaneous explanation for decisions.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">Norton v. Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance</span> <span class="case-citation">(542 U.S. 55, 2004)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> Environmental groups sued BLM under APA § 706(1) to "compel agency action unlawfully withheld," arguing BLM failed to protect wilderness study areas from off-road vehicle damage as required by statute.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> Courts can compel agency action under § 706(1) only when agency failed to take discrete action it was legally required to take. Claims seeking broad programmatic improvements are not reviewable.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Justice Scalia emphasized that courts cannot compel general compliance with broad statutory mandates. APA permits review only of "agency action," defined as discrete and circumscribed. Duty must be legally required, not discretionary. Mandating particular land management approach would inappropriately inject courts into day-to-day agency operations.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Limited judicial review of agency inaction. Established "discrete" and "legally required" limitations on § 706(1) claims. Prevented courts from assuming broad supervisory role over agencies. Protected agency resource allocation decisions from judicial interference.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>B. Final Agency Action</h3>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">Bennett v. Spear</span> <span class="case-citation">(520 U.S. 154, 1997)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> Fish and Wildlife Service issued Biological Opinion under Endangered Species Act that restricted water use to protect endangered fish. Ranchers and irrigation districts challenged the restrictions as excessive.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> Biological Opinion was "final agency action" reviewable under APA. Agency action is final when (1) it marks consummation of decision-making process and (2) determines rights/obligations or has legal consequences.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Justice Scalia established two-part test for finality. Biological Opinion marked end of consultation process, not tentative or interlocutory. It had direct legal consequences because action agency would risk liability by disregarding it. Even though opinion technically only "advisory," it had practical binding effect.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Created definitive test for "final agency action" requirement. Focused on practical consequences rather than formal legal status. Recognized that nominally advisory actions can have binding effects. Established ripple effect as basis for causation in standing analysis.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">Sackett v. EPA</span> <span class="case-citation">(566 U.S. 120, 2012)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> EPA issued compliance order to landowners who filled wetlands, claiming Clean Water Act violation. Order required restoration and threatened penalties up to $75,000/day. Sacketts sought pre-enforcement review of order.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> EPA compliance order was final agency action reviewable under APA. Clean Water Act did not preclude pre-enforcement review.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Justice Scalia applied Bennett test. Compliance order determined Sacketts' obligations and exposed them to increased penalties. Order marked consummation of fact-finding process regarding whether property contained wetlands. Sacketts faced legal consequences (potential liability) and had no other adequate remedy.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Extended judicial review to agency compliance orders previously thought unreviewable. Applied Bennett factors pragmatically. Limited agency's ability to act without judicial oversight. Demonstrated Court's increasing skepticism of agency procedural shortcuts.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>C. Standing</h3>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife</span> <span class="case-citation">(504 U.S. 555, 1992)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> Environmental groups challenged regulation limiting Endangered Species Act's consultation requirement to actions within U.S. or on high seas. Plaintiffs claimed injury based on members' past visits to affected areas and intention to return "some day."</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> Plaintiffs lacked standing because they failed to show concrete, particularized, actual or imminent injury. "Some day" intentions to visit affected areas were too speculative to constitute "imminent" injury.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Justice Scalia articulated three-part standing test: (1) injury-in-fact that is concrete and particularized, and actual or imminent; (2) causal connection between injury and challenged conduct; (3) likelihood that favorable decision will redress injury. "Some day" intentions were insufficient for imminence. Mere interest in problem without concrete harm doesn't confer standing.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Established modern Article III standing framework. Reinforced injury requirement as constitutional limitation on judicial power. Limited Congress's ability to create procedural rights without concrete injury. Limited "citizen suit" provisions. Kennedy concurrence recognized ecosystem nexus theory.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">Massachusetts v. EPA</span> <span class="case-citation">(549 U.S. 497, 2007)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> Massachusetts and other states petitioned EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles under Clean Air Act. EPA denied petition, arguing it lacked authority and citing policy reasons against regulation.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> States had standing based on "special solicitude" in standing analysis. EPA had authority to regulate greenhouse gases and needed to ground its decision on statutory criteria.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Justice Stevens held that Massachusetts had standing due to: (1) "special solicitude" as sovereign state protecting quasi-sovereign interests; (2) concrete injury through loss of coastal land due to sea level rise; (3) causation through EPA's failure to regulate emissions contributing to climate change; (4) partial redressability through regulations that would slow climate change.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Created "special solicitude" doctrine for state standing. Relaxed traditional standing requirements, particularly causation and redressability, for states and climate change cases. Expanded EPA authority to include greenhouse gases as "air pollutants." Later limited by UARG and West Virginia.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">Summers v. Earth Island Institute</span> <span class="case-citation">(555 U.S. 488, 2009)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> Environmental groups challenged Forest Service regulations exempting small timber sales from notice, comment, and appeal procedures. Initially challenged specific project, but that dispute was settled. Groups continued facial challenge to regulations.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> Plaintiffs lacked standing for facial challenge after settling specific project dispute. Generalized harm to unspecified members who might visit unidentified sites in future was insufficient.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Justice Scalia reaffirmed Lujan's concrete injury requirement. Plaintiffs failed to identify specific members with concrete plans to visit specific affected sites. "Statistical probability" that some members would be affected insufficient. Dissent noted affidavits showing regular use of national forests and likelihood members would encounter projects.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Reinforced strict application of standing requirements. Limited "procedural injury" standing. Required plaintiffs challenging widespread government action to identify specific affected individuals. Demonstrated continuing importance of identifying concrete applications of challenged policies.</p>
