    <h1>Administrative Law Exam Reference - Major Cases (Separation of Powers & Agency Authority)</h1>
    
    <div class="exam-tip">
        <p><strong>How to Use This Section:</strong> This part contains key separation of powers and agency authority cases with detailed analyses. Each case includes facts, holding, reasoning, and significance. You should be able to apply these precedents to analogous fact patterns on the exam.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>I. Separation of Powers Cases</h2>
    
    <h3>A. The Nondelegation Doctrine</h3>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States</span> <span class="case-citation">(295 U.S. 495, 1935)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) authorized the President to approve "codes of fair competition" drafted by industry groups. The Schechter brothers were convicted of violating the "Live Poultry Code" established under NIRA.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> The Supreme Court unanimously struck down NIRA as an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. Congress had provided no standards to guide the President's discretion in approving codes.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Chief Justice Hughes emphasized that Congress cannot delegate its legislative power to the President or private groups. The Act provided "no standards" to constrain executive discretion in approving codes. The Constitution does not allow Congress to transfer its essential legislative functions.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> One of only two successful nondelegation challenges in history. Established that delegations require an "intelligible principle" to guide agency discretion. Example of invalid delegation with unlimited discretion.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">Whitman v. American Trucking Associations</span> <span class="case-citation">(531 U.S. 457, 2001)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> Clean Air Act directed EPA to set air quality standards "requisite to protect public health" with an "adequate margin of safety." Industry groups challenged this as an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power without intelligible principle.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> The Court unanimously upheld the delegation, finding that the statutory language provided a sufficiently intelligible principle to guide EPA's discretion.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Justice Scalia wrote that the Court has "almost never felt qualified to second-guess Congress" regarding the permissibility of delegations. The language "requisite to protect public health" with an "adequate margin of safety" provided sufficient guidance. Court rejected D.C. Circuit's novel approach of having agency itself supply limiting construction.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Exemplifies modern Court's reluctance to invalidate delegations. Demonstrates that even broad standards like "requisite to protect public health" are sufficient intelligible principles.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">Gundy v. United States</span> <span class="case-citation">(139 S.Ct. 2116, 2019)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) authorized Attorney General to specify registration requirements for sex offenders convicted before the Act. Gundy, a pre-Act offender, challenged this as unconstitutional delegation.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> By plurality, the Court upheld the delegation. However, the opinions signaled possible future changes to nondelegation doctrine.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Justice Kagan's plurality (4 justices) found the statute gave Attorney General authority only to apply SORNA to pre-Act offenders, not discretion on whether to apply it. Justice Alito concurred but expressed willingness to reconsider nondelegation doctrine. Justice Gorsuch's dissent (joined by Roberts and Thomas) argued for more robust nondelegation doctrine based on original understanding.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Signals potential revival of stricter nondelegation doctrine in future cases. Gorsuch dissent provides roadmap for future challenges. Subsequent confirmation of Justice Barrett (replacing Ginsburg from plurality) may indicate shift in Court's approach.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>B. Legislative Power Limitations</h3>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">INS v. Chadha</span> <span class="case-citation">(462 U.S. 919, 1983)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> Immigration and Nationality Act allowed one house of Congress to veto executive branch decision to suspend deportation. Chadha's deportation was suspended, but House of Representatives vetoed this suspension.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> The legislative veto violated constitutional requirements of bicameralism (passage by both houses) and presentment (presenting legislation to President for approval).</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Chief Justice Burger emphasized that actions with legislative effect must comply with Article I's procedural requirements. The Constitution's separation of powers does not permit Congress to control execution of laws except through bicameralism and presentment. The veto allowed Congress to share executive power without following constitutional process.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Invalidated hundreds of legislative veto provisions across federal statutes. Reinforced formal approach to separation of powers. Established that Congress cannot directly control agency action outside of bicameralism and presentment.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">Clinton v. City of New York</span> <span class="case-citation">(524 U.S. 417, 1998)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> Line Item Veto Act authorized President to "cancel" certain spending and tax benefit provisions after signing bills into law. President Clinton used this authority to cancel provisions benefiting New York City.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> The Line Item Veto Act violated the Presentment Clause by allowing the President to unilaterally amend or repeal parts of statutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Justice Stevens explained that the Constitution provides a single, finely wrought procedure for enacting laws: bicameral passage and presentment to the President for approval or veto. The Line Item Veto Act created a different procedure not authorized by the Constitution. By allowing President to effectively create a different law than Congress passed, it violated separation of powers.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Reinforced formalist approach to separation of powers. Established that even when Congress attempts to give power to the President, such grants must comply with constitutional procedures.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>C. Executive Power & Presidential Control</h3>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">Buckley v. Valeo</span> <span class="case-citation">(424 U.S. 1, 1976)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> Federal Election Campaign Act established Federal Election Commission with members appointed partly by President, partly by Congress. Commission had both rulemaking and enforcement powers.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> The appointment structure violated the Appointments Clause. Only the President can appoint officers of the United States with Senate confirmation.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> The Court held that commission members exercised executive power as "Officers of the United States" under Article II. The Appointments Clause gives appointment power exclusively to President (with Senate confirmation for principal officers). Congressional appointments to a body with executive functions violated separation of powers.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Established that entities exercising executive power must be appointed according to Appointments Clause. Limited Congress's ability to insulate agencies from presidential control through appointment power.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">Morrison v. Olson</span> <span class="case-citation">(487 U.S. 654, 1988)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> Ethics in Government Act created an independent counsel, appointed by special court, who could investigate and prosecute high-ranking officials. Independent counsel could only be removed by Attorney General for "good cause."</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> The Court upheld the independent counsel provisions against separation of powers challenge. For-cause removal protection did not unduly interfere with President's Article II powers.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Chief Justice Rehnquist adopted functional approach, finding that "good cause" removal restriction did not "unduly trammel on executive authority." Independent counsel was an inferior officer with limited jurisdiction and tenure. The Act did not impermissibly undermine President's constitutional role.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Endorsed functional approach to separation of powers. Allowed certain limits on President's removal power. Scalia's lone dissent argued for more formal approach, has gained influence in later cases.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB</span> <span class="case-citation">(561 U.S. 477, 2010)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> Sarbanes-Oxley Act created Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) with members appointed by SEC and removable only for good cause. SEC Commissioners themselves were understood to be removable only for good cause.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> Dual for-cause removal restrictions were unconstitutional. President must have ability to hold those who exercise executive power accountable.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Chief Justice Roberts emphasized that two layers of for-cause protection unconstitutionally insulated Board from presidential control. This arrangement contradicted Article II's vesting of executive power in the President. The President could not hold SEC accountable for Board's conduct, which undermined democratic accountability.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Signaled shift toward more formalist approach to separation of powers. Limited Morrison without overruling it. Established that multiple layers of removal protection are unconstitutional.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">Seila Law LLC v. CFPB</span> <span class="case-citation">(140 S.Ct. 2183, 2020)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was headed by single Director who could only be removed by President for inefficiency, neglect, or malfeasance. CFPB was investigating Seila Law, which challenged agency's structure.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> Single-director independent agency structure with for-cause removal protection violated separation of powers. The Court articulated only two exceptions to President's removal power: multi-member expert bodies and inferior officers with limited duties.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Chief Justice Roberts held that Constitution gives President "general" power to remove executive officers. History established only two exceptions: multi-member expert commissions (Humphrey's Executor) and certain inferior officers (Morrison). Single-director agency with significant executive power fit neither exception.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Narrowed permissible removal restrictions. Effectively limited Humphrey's Executor to multi-member commissions. Distinguished between single-director and multi-member independent agencies. Found CFPB structure unconstitutional but severed removal restriction rather than invalidating entire agency.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>II. Major Agency Authority Cases</h2>
    
    <h3>A. Major Questions Doctrine</h3>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.</span> <span class="case-citation">(529 U.S. 120, 2000)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> FDA asserted authority to regulate tobacco products as "drugs" and "devices" under Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act. Tobacco companies challenged this interpretation.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> FDA lacked authority to regulate tobacco products despite seemingly broad statutory language.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Justice O'Connor examined broader statutory context and legislative history. FDA had repeatedly disclaimed authority over tobacco. Congress had enacted tobacco-specific regulatory scheme and rejected FDA regulation. Given economic and political significance of tobacco regulation, Court expected clear congressional authorization.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Early articulation of what became Major Questions Doctrine. Established principle that courts should be skeptical of agency claims of authority in matters of vast economic and political significance without clear congressional authorization.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA</span> <span class="case-citation">(573 U.S. 302, 2014)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> After Massachusetts v. EPA found greenhouse gases could be "air pollutants" under Clean Air Act, EPA determined that regulating GHGs from motor vehicles triggered permitting requirements for stationary sources.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> EPA could not rewrite clear statutory thresholds for permitting requirements, though it could require "best available control technology" for GHGs from sources otherwise subject to Prevention of Significant Deterioration program.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Justice Scalia rejected EPA's expansive interpretation that would radically expand its regulatory authority. EPA's interpretation would require permits for millions of small sources Congress never intended to regulate. When agency claims to discover in long-extant statute unheralded power to regulate significant portion of economy, Court expects clear congressional authorization.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Further developed Major Questions Doctrine. Distinguished between reasonable interpretation and agency overreach. Limited Massachusetts v. EPA by restricting EPA's authority to extend greenhouse gas regulation beyond statutory bounds.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">West Virginia v. EPA</span> <span class="case-citation">(142 S.Ct. 2587, 2022)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> EPA's Clean Power Plan set carbon emission limits for power plants based on generation shifting (shifting from coal to natural gas or renewables). Power plants and coal-producing states challenged EPA's authority.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> EPA exceeded statutory authority by attempting to restructure nation's electricity generation mix. Clear statement rule applies when agency claims authority to make decisions of vast economic and political significance.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Chief Justice Roberts explicitly recognized Major Questions Doctrine. CAA § 111(d) was general provision that had never been used for such transformative regulation. Generation shifting was not a "system of emission reduction" within EPA's traditional expertise or authority. Court required clear congressional authorization for such significant economic and political decisions.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Explicitly named and formalized Major Questions Doctrine. Limited agency authority in areas of vast economic/political significance without clear congressional authorization. Provided framework for future challenges to ambitious regulatory programs.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">NFIB v. OSHA</span> <span class="case-citation">(142 S.Ct. 661, 2022)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> OSHA issued emergency temporary standard (ETS) requiring COVID-19 vaccination or testing for all employers with 100+ employees. Various parties challenged OSHA's authority to issue this mandate.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> OSHA exceeded its statutory authority. Occupational Safety and Health Act authorized workplace safety regulations, not broad public health measures affecting 84 million workers.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Per curiam opinion applied Major Questions Doctrine. COVID-19 was not an occupational hazard but a universal risk. OSHA never before asserted such broad authority over public health. Court expected Congress to speak clearly before authorizing agency to exercise powers of vast economic and political significance.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Applied Major Questions Doctrine to emergency context. Distinguished between workplace risks and general public health risks. Limited agency authority to act on significant health issues without specific congressional authorization.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>B. Statutory Interpretation & Deference</h3>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. NRDC</span> <span class="case-citation">(467 U.S. 837, 1984)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> EPA interpreted Clean Air Act term "stationary source" to include all pollution-emitting devices within single industrial grouping ("bubble concept"). NRDC challenged this interpretation.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> EPA's interpretation was permissible construction of ambiguous statute. Courts should defer to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Justice Stevens established two-step framework: (1) If Congress has directly spoken to precise question, court and agency must give effect to unambiguous intent; (2) If statute is ambiguous, court defers to agency's reasonable interpretation. EPA's bubble concept was reasonable policy choice to accommodate competing interests.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Created influential deference framework that governed for 40 years. Recognized agencies' superior expertise and political accountability. Note: Overruled by Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (2024).</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">United States v. Mead Corp.</span> <span class="case-citation">(533 U.S. 218, 2001)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> Customs Service issued tariff classification ruling letters without notice-and-comment procedures. Mead challenged a ruling that reclassified its day planners with higher tariff.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> Chevron deference applies only when Congress delegated authority to agency to make rules carrying force of law, and agency interpretation was promulgated in exercise of that authority.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Justice Souter limited Chevron's scope. Chevron applies when Congress delegated authority to make rules with force of law and agency acted under that authority, typically through formal procedures. Informal interpretations may receive respect based on persuasiveness under Skidmore. Court remanded to determine if ruling letter deserved Skidmore respect.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Limited Chevron's domain. Established "force of law" test for Chevron eligibility. Revived Skidmore deference for informal interpretations. Created more nuanced deference regime.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="case-summary">
        <h4><span class="case-name">Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo</span> <span class="case-citation">(600 U.S. ___, 2024)</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong> National Marine Fisheries Service required fishing vessels to pay for mandatory observers. Fishing companies challenged agency's authority to impose these costs under Magnuson-Stevens Act.</p>
        <p><strong>Holding:</strong> Overruled Chevron deference. Courts must determine best reading of statute using traditional tools of statutory interpretation, without deferring to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Chief Justice Roberts held that Chevron contradicted separation of powers principles and traditional judicial role. Courts have duty to say what the law is without automatic deference to agencies. Agencies' policy expertise does not justify judicial abdication. Instead, courts should consider agency views under Skidmore framework based on their persuasiveness.</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Fundamentally changed administrative law by eliminating Chevron deference. Restored traditional tools of statutory interpretation. Enhanced judicial role in reviewing agency statutory interpretations. Agency interpretations now evaluated under Skidmore's persuasiveness framework.</p>
